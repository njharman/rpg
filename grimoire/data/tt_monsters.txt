##II. New Monsters

Alabaster Homunculus
No. Enc.: 1 (1d4)
Alignment: Neutral
Movement: 90' (30')
Armor Class: 3
Hit Dice: 1 (6 hit points)
Attacks: None

Hoard Class: None
XP: 10
Servants created by powerful magic-users, these creatures are small (1'
high) alabaster figurines carved in a likeness of their master. They are
carved so as to contain an internal cavity with a lid or stopper in the top
of their heads. The cavity is filled with the master's blood, giving the
creature a translucent pinkish tinge. This blood, in conjunction with
magic spells, gives life to the homunculus.
In its normal state, an alabaster homunculus is inanimate, preferring to
stand absolutely still, as if a normal statue. In this state the creature is
utterly defenceless, and can be killed if the blood is poured out from its
body. However during the creation of the homunculus, the magic-user
chooses a secret command word which can be used to activate it. When
the command word is spoken (with unlimited range) the homunculus
immediately awakens to do the caster's bidding. When activated, the
caster has a vague telepathic link with the homunculus which allows him
to give commands to the creature, and it in turn to silently give reports of
its whereabouts. An activated homunculus is incredibly stealthy, having a
5 in 6 chance of being undetected by observers. The homunculus is
small and weak, and while able to carry small items (such as a scroll or a
key), it is incapable of combat. A homunculus can remain active for up to
24 hours per week.
Alabaster homunculi are typically created as guardians of a magic-user's
home, as they can be contacted at any distance and be used to keep an
eye on the place while the caster is away. They are also sometimes
useful in emergency situations, as an aide to a magic-user who is
endangered in his home. These homunculi, when inactive, usually stand
in a secret location, where they are unlikely to be found or disturbed.

Death Cap, Giant
No. Enc.: 1d8 (1d8)
Alignment: Neutral
Movement: 0
Armor Class: 7
Hit Dice: 2
Attacks: None
Damage: None
Save: F2
Morale: 12
Hoard Class: VII
XP: 38
Giant death caps are pale greenish mushrooms growing up to 6' in
height. They are immobile and have no form of attack, but emanate a
sinister charm which entices creatures coming within 30' to approach
the fungus and eat of their flesh. A saving throw versus spells is allowed
to resist the charm. The mushrooms' flesh contains a potent poison,
causing death within 1d6 rounds unless a successful saving throw is
made.
The ground around giant death caps is often littered with the mycelium-
riddled remains of previous victims, which may conceal treasure.

##Elementals
##==========
##In addition to the planes composed of the four classical elements (fire,
##air, earth & water) and the elementals which dwell there, a number of
##other elemental planes exist which are in turn inhabited by their own
##unique elementals. A selection of such creatures is detailed here.
##The exact nature of the cosmological connection between the classical
##elemental planes and these new planes is left to the Referee to
##decide. It could be that they are simply lesser, or lesser-known, elemental
##planes, or they could alternatively be viewed as sub-planes which are
##formed where two of the classical elemental planes meet. For example
##the plane of lava might be seen as an intersection between the planes of
##fire and earth.

Ash Elementals: Ash elementals appear as a creeping mass of black ash
and smoke. For every hit die possessed they are 2' in diameter and 1/2'
high. Their attacks cause damage by desiccation and choking. Anyone
within 20' of an ash elemental must save versus poison or suffer -2 to
attack rolls due to the blinding smoke. The touch of an ash elemental is
toxic to plants – normal plants wither and die, while plant-like monsters
automatically suffer 1d8 hit points damage per round.

Frost Elementals: Frost elementals appear as giant humanoids made of
frost and ice, and are 2' high for every hit die possessed. They freeze
water on touch – up to 100 square feet per round, up to a depth of 6
inches. When in contact with snow or ice, a frost elemental regenerates
1d6 hit points per round. They suffer half damage from cold based
attacks, and double damage from fire.

Lava Elementals: Lava elementals appear as giant, roughly-shaped
humanoids made of magma and volcanic rock. They are 2' high for
every hit die possessed. Lava elementals are surrounded by a 20' radius
area of searing heat – causing metals to heat up. Upon the second round
within range, all characters using metallic weapons or armour suffer 1d4
hit points damage. On the 3rd and subsequent rounds in the creature's
presence, metal using characters suffer 2d4 hit points damage and
others suffer 1d4 hit points damage. Any wooden objects touching a
lava elemental burst into flame.

Mud Elementals: Mud elementals appear as a seething slimy mass of
ooze and silt. For every hit die possessed they are 2' in diameter and
1/2' high. They attack by lashing out with sticky waves of goo,
attempting to drag victims into their ooze. A target which is successfully
hit by a mud elemental will be pulled into its mass and automatically
suffer smothering damage each round. Mud elementals can smother any
number of victims, but can only make an attack against one new target
per round.
A mud elemental's form is completely mutable, allowing it to move
through very small spaces such as the gap beneath a door. They are
equally at home on land or in water.

Steam
No. Enc.: 1 (1)
Alignment: Neutral
Movement: 180' (60') – flying

Hoard Class: None
XP: 1,570/2,800/3,300

Steam Elementals: Steam elementals appear as an amorphous cloud of
searing steam approximately 2' in diameter per hit die. They attack by
condensing their form and enveloping a target, causing damage by
burning. The creature's heat is such that it kills any normal plants or
insects it comes into contact with, and causes 1d6 hit points damage to
all creatures within 20'.

Elementines are semi-intelligent beings made of pure elemental matter of
one kind or another. They are native to the elemental planes, but can be
summoned by certain spells. Elementines can only be harmed by magic
and magical weapons.
There are two different power levels of elementines, and the type
present will be determined by the spell used to summon them. Lesser
elementines have AC 4, HD 1 and are generally around 2' in diameter,
whereas greater elementines have AC 2, HD 3 and are around 5' in
diameter.

Air Elementines: Air elementines are formed of powerful wind vortices,
and are usually only visible by the dust which they stir up as they move.
They 'attack' foes by surrounding them with their chaotic air currents,
not causing any damage but potentially distracting and confusing the
target. A creature successfully attacked by an air elementine suffers -2 to
its attacks due to the distraction, and cannot cast spells or use missile
weapons. These effects last for one round. A creature attacked by a
greater air elementine must also make a save versus paralysis or be
stunned for 1d4 rounds.

Earth Elementines: Earth elementines can only manifest within a large
body of stone or earth – usually the ground. They can move within this
earth medium without being noticed (except by detect magic), and attack
by disrupting the ground beneath an opponent's feet. The attack does
not cause any damage, but the target is usually knocked over and is
stunned for one round. Attacks by greater earth elementines cause the
target to be stunned for 1 to 3 rounds.

Fire Elementines: Fire elementines appear as a sphere of flame. The
creature attacks simply by touching an opponent, causing damage and
the ignition of flammable materials.

Water Elementines: Water elementines appear as a spherical or snake-
like formation in a body of water, and can only be summoned where a
sufficient quantity of water exists – at least a small pool. They cannot
leave the body of water from which they are formed. They attack by
overwhelming opponents, causing damage by drowning. Creatures
which can breathe water are unaffected by a water elementine's attacks,
but fire-based creatures suffer double damage.

Flame Terror
No. Enc.: 1 (2–8)
Alignment: Neutral (Evil)
Movement: 150' (40')
Armor Class: 3
Hit Dice: 4+4
Attacks: 1 (flame gout)
Damage: 1d10
Save: F4
Morale: 10
Hoard Class: None
XP: 290
Flame terrors are evil creatures native to the plane of fire, where they are
not uncommon. They are occasionally summoned to the material plane
by magic-users. They take one of several forms: a raging column of fire,
a humanoid with flames in place of legs, or a bronze statue wreathed in
flames.
In combat flame terrors have the ability to blink, as per the spell. No fire-
based or fire-affecting spells can function within 20' of a flame terror.

Fly Agaric, Monstrous
No. Enc.: 1 (1–4)
Alignment: Neutral
Movement: 0
Armor Class: 7
Hit Dice: 3
Attacks: Spore cloud
Damage: See below
Save: F3
Morale: 12
Hoard Class: None
XP: 80
The “toadstools" of folklore, these giant red & white spotted fungi stand
up to 6' tall. While they have no form of direct attack, they present two
dangers to adventurers. Firstly, they are typically host to a seething
swarm of flies and maggots (see the Insect swarm monster in the
Referee book). Secondly, anyone coming within 5' of a
monstrous fly agaric must save versus poison or be affected by the spell
confusion, due to the hallucinogenic effects of the mushroom’s spores.

Fluid Beast
No. Enc.: 1–3 (2–5)
Alignment: Neutral (Evil)
Movement: 60' (20') / 180' (60') – swimming
Armor Class: 5
Hit Dice: 6+6
Attacks: 3 (2 jets, slam)
Damage: 1d4/1d4/4d4
Save: F6
Morale: 10
Hoard Class: None
XP: 680
Fluid beasts are evil creatures native to the plane of water, but are
sometimes encountered on the material plane if summoned by magic.
They have several possible forms, which they can switch between at will:
a fountain or pool of water, a green-tinged cloud in a body of water, or a
gelatinous blob riddled with pipes and tentacles.
On land they attack by expelling high pressured water jets, effective at
up to 10' away, and having a 1 in 6 chance of blinding victims for 1d6
rounds. In the water their attack is deadlier, as they use their water jets to
propel their huge bulk into their victims in a violent slamming attack.
No water-based or water-affecting spells can function within 20' of a
fluid beast.

Goblin, Fey
No. Enc.: 2d4 (6d10)
Alignment: Neutral or Chaotic
Movement: 60' (20')
Armor Class: 6
Hit Dice: 1
Attacks: 1 (weapon)
Damage: 1d6 or weapon
Save: MU1
Morale: 7
Hoard Class: III (XX)
XP: 16
Cousins of normal goblins, fey goblins dwell in mysterious dimensions
which exist in parallel to the physical world. Crossover points sometimes
exist between the two dimensions, allowing those versed in their use to
travel between worlds.
Their appearance is similar to that of normal goblins: 3' tall, with red or
yellow eyes, and orange tinged skin. However, fey goblins, even
members of the same tribe, vary wildly in form, no two looking alike.
Their facial features may be extremely distorted, with huge noses,
mouths, ears or eyes. Odd features such as giant hands, or extremely
long arms or fingers are not uncommon. Likewise they typically dress in
a bizarre hodgepodge of styles, often combining various types of armour
piecemeal.
Fey goblins are naturally magical, and gain a +4 bonus to saving throws
against illusions or mind-affecting magic. 1 in 4 fey goblins additionally
has one of the following abilities, usable once per day: dimension leap or
limited invisibility (as a fey elf), ray of fire / cold (as an elementalist),
color spray or wall of vapor (as an illusionist).
Their organisation is similar to that of normal goblins, including the use
of dire wolves as mounts and the presence of a goblin king and
bodyguards. Fey goblin kings always know two of the magical abilities
listed above.

Leprotic Dead
No. Enc.: 1d6 (2d6)
Alignment: Chaotic
Movement: 90' (30')
Armor Class: 6
Hit Dice: 3
Attacks: 2
Damage: 1d6 + disease
Save: F 3
Morale: 12
Hoard Class: None
XP: 80
Swathed in loose rags or bandages, the flesh of these undead monsters
can be seen to crawl and seethe. Their flesh is in a strange state between
life and death – at once riddled with disease and virulently alive.
Each round of combat, leprotic dead regenerate two hit points. Severed
limbs can be reattached, and even fatal damage taking he creature below
0hp can be regenerated. The only way they can be permanently killed is
by fire.
In melee the leprotic dead attack with their fists. Each successful hit
carries with it the risk of leprosy infection. The target must save versus
poison, with a +3 bonus, or contract the disease. Infected victims suffer a
loss of 2 points of CHA per month, dying when CHA reaches 0. Those
who die from the disease will themselves become leprotic dead.
Although they hoard and carry no treasure themselves, leprotic dead are
often found as guardians of ancient treasure troves.

Soil Fiend
No. Enc.: 1 (2–5)
Alignment: Neutral (Evil)
Movement: 120' (40') / 30' (10') – burrowing
Armor Class: 4
Hit Dice: 5+5
Attacks: 2 (claws)
Damage: 1d8/1d8
Save: F5
Morale: 10
Hoard Class: None
XP: 860
Soil fiends are evil creatures native to the plane of earth, where they live
in labyrinthine burrows. They are occasionally encountered on the
material plane when summoned by magic. Soil fiends usually appear as
swine-like beasts with a grinning skull for a head and a back covered
with sharp spines. They may also change into a rough humanoid form
of slimy, lumpy clay.
Soil fiends are able to meld into bare earth or stone, leaving only a vague
moist outline. They can then leap suddenly to attack, surprising on a roll
of 1–5.
In combat, if a victim is successfully attacked by both the fiend's claws in
one round, then the creature manages to cling onto the target. Once a
soil fiend is clinging to a target it automatically inflicts 2d6 damage per
round, and cannot be removed unless killed.
No earth-affecting magic can function within 40' of a soil fiend.

Warp Fiend
No. Enc.: 1 (1)
Alignment: Chaotic (Evil)
Movement: 120' (40')
Armor Class: 1
Hit Dice: 6
Attacks: 1 (special)
Damage: None
Save: MU6
Morale: 10
Hoard Class: None
XP: 1070
A horror summoned from the bizarre spaces which exist between
dimensions, the warp fiend's appearance defies comprehension, being
constructed of impossible geometrical forms and textures. Merely looking
upon the creature is enough to trigger temporary madness – all viewing
a warp fiend must save versus spells of be affected by the confusion
spell.
Warp fiends have no physical form of attack, but have several magical
abilities which they use to cause mayhem. A warp fiend can use one of
the following abilities once per round: conjure a 10' square wall of force,
teleport one creature up to 50' (without error), dispel magic as a 6th
level magic-user.

Wind Horror
No. Enc.: 1 (2–8)
Alignment: Neutral (Evil)
Movement: 30' (10') / 240' (80') – flying
Armor Class: 2
Hit Dice: 4
Attacks: 1
Damage: 3d4
Save: F4
Morale: 10
Hoard Class: None
XP: 190
Wind horrors are natives of the plane of air, but can be summoned to
the material plane by magic-users. They are typically invisible, being only
noticeable as a strong gust of wind. In this form they move at 80' per
round. In order to attack a, wind horror must manifest into a dense
cloud of fog filled with lashing tentacles and sinister eyes.
The wind horror's attack takes the form of a blast of fine particles
emitted from its whirlwind-like core. The blast can target a single
creature up to 30' distant.
Wind horrors are immune to normal weapons, and are only able to be
harmed by spells or magical weapons of +2 or greater enchantment. All
air-affecting magic fails within 50' of a wind horror.
