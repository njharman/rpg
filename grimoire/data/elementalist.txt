Amalgam of Earth and Air

Duration: 1 turn
Range: Special
Conjures a large quantity of a supernatural substance possessing the qualities
of both earth and air. This amalgam can be formed into any shape the caster
desires, of a volume up to 10 cubic feet per caster level. The caster is able
to determine the amalgam's properties from any of the following: solid or
substanceless, heavy or weightless, breathable or suffocating.  The amalgam's
form and properties can be altered incredibly quickly, with a mere thought
from the caster, and he is able to move it up to 60' per round. Creatures
inside the volume of the amalgam may, at the caster's option, suffer 3d6 hit
points damage per round due to crushing or suffocation.  At the end of the
spell's duration the amalgam disappears instantly.

Amalgam of Fire and Water
Level: 6
Duration: 1 turn
Range: Special
Similar to |Amalgam of Earth and Air|_, this spell creates a substance which
possesses the qualities of both fire and water. The properties which the
amalgam can exhibit include any of the following: cold or hot, smothering or
burning, falling or rising. The amalgam can cause up to 3d6 hit points damage
per round to creatures inside its volume, due to extreme cold, heat or
burning.

Brimstone Monolith
Level: 9
Duration: 4d6 rounds
Range: 30'
This powerful and dangerous spell creates a short-lived dimensional rift,
summoning forth the destructive powers of the elemental planes of fire and
earth.  In addition to the dangers inherent in casting this spell, there is
a 20% chance that the gaze of Imix is cast upon the caster. The
attention of this being is seldom sympathetic.
The incantations required to cast this spell are more complex than usual,
taking several rounds to complete.  The casting of the spell cannot be
disrupted by damage caused as a direct result of the spell's effects (from the
earthquake or flames). However if the casting of the spell is interrupted in
any other way, the effects described for any subsequent rounds do not occur.
**1st round:** An earthquake occurs, as the 7th level spell, centred on the
caster.
**2nd round:** A monolith of brimstone rips through the fractured surface of
the earth. The monolith is approximately 20' high and 10' in diameter. All
creatures within 60' of the monolith, including the caster, suffer 2d6 hit
points fire damage per round due to the searing heat and flames which surround
it.
**3rd round:** Upon the final round of the incantation, the dimensional gateway
is opened, summoning forth violent elemental creatures (see table below). The
summoned creatures are not under the caster's control, and are bent on causing
as much destruction as possible.  The gateway allows travel both ways between
the connected planes, thus it can be used as a means of gaining entry into the
elemental planes of fire or earth.
**4th and subsequent rounds:** monolith begins to shudder, emitting a deafening
roar, and shooting out jets of magma and sheets of flame. Each round there is
25% chance of a random target within 100' being hit by one of the monolith's
emissions, causing 5d6 damage, save for 1/2.
When the spell's duration comes to an end, the monolith recedes into
the earth, all summoned creatures disappear, and the dimensional rift
closes.

Elemental Cancellation

Duration: Instantaneous
Range: 120'
Similar to |Dispel Magic|_, this spell enables caster to dispel ongoing

a torch 20' radius.  The caster may cause the flame to flare suddenly,
dazzling any creatures within 30', save negates. Dazzled creatures suffer -2
to attack rolls for 2 rounds. The caster is not affected by the flare, but his
allies may be, unless warned to shut their eyes. After the firelight flares it
disappears and the spell ends. Alternatively, it may be thrown 30' causing no
damage but setting alight combustibles.

Incinerate / Uncinerate
Level: 2
Duration: Special
Range: 20'
Cast as part of a ritual resulting in the transformation of an
object into a pile of enchanted ashes which can later be reinstated with
the reversed form of the spell.
The affected non-living object need not be normally combustible.  The spell
must be cast as the object is placed into a fire large enough to contain it,
and the caster must continue the ritual until the fire has died down and the
burned object has crumbled to ash. At this point the ashes should be collected
and stored in a suitable container.
At a later date, using the reversed form of the spell, the enchanted ashes can
be transformed back into the original object as it existed before it was
burned.  The reinstatement takes 1d6 rounds, during which time an eerie black
fire surrounds the ashes, which causes 1d4 hit points damage to any creature
in contact.

wind, sea, rivers, waterfalls or fire. A source of such sound must already

cannot deny the pact and must accept the amulet. Once made, the pact can only
be broken if either of the amulets leaves its owner's possession.  The bound
Efreeti cannot discard its amulet of its own accord; however, chaotic and wily
