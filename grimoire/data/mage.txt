projects above the ground. 6 human-sized creatures can fit in with the
caster; they can freely pass into and out of the hut without harming it.
However, if the caster removes himself from the hut, the spell ends. The
temperature inside the hut is nominally 70F.  However, an exterior temperature
below 0° or above 100° lowers or raises the interior temperature on
a 1-degree-for-1 basis. The hut also provides protection against the elements,
such as rain, dust, and sandstorms. The hut withstands any wind up to 50 mph,
but greater force destroys it.  Missiles, weapons, and most spell effects can
pass through the hut without affecting it.  The caster can illuminate the

##Guards and Wards
##Level: 6
##Duration: 6 turns per level
##Range: 0
##This powerful spell is primarily used to defend a stronghold. The
##ward protects a 10' radius per caster level. The spell creates the following magical
##effects within the warded area.
##Fog: Fog fills all corridors, obscuring all sight, including
##infravision, beyond 10'.
##wizard Locks: All doors in the warded area are arcane locked.
##Webs: Webs fill all stairs from top to bottom. These strands are
##identical with those created by the web spell, except that they
##regrow in 10 minutes if they are burned or torn away while the
##guards and wards spell lasts.
##Confusion: Where there are choices in direction·such as a
##corridor intersection or side passage·a minor confusion-type
##effect functions so as to make it 50% probable that intruders
##believe they are going in the opposite direction from the one
##they actually chose.
##Lost Doors: One door per caster level is covered by an illusion
##to appear as if it were a plain wall.
##In addition, the caster can place one of the following five
##magical effects.
##1. Dancing lights in four corridors.
##2. A magic mouth in two places.
##3. A stinking cloud in two places. The vapors appear in
##the places designated; they return within 10 minutes if
##dispersed by wind while the guards and wards spell
##lasts.

##5. A suggestion in one place. The caster selects an area
##of up to 5' square, and any creature who enters or
##passes through the area receives the suggestion
##mentally.
##The whole warded area radiates strong magic. |Dispel Magic|_ cast
##on a specific effect, if successful, removes only that effect.

##Identify
##Level: 1
##Duration: 1 round per level
##Range: Touch
##This spell may be used to determine the magical properties of a
##single magic item. However, the caster must be holding or
##wearing the item according to its function and the spell must be
##cast no later than 1 hour after it comes into the caster's
##possession. Weapons must be held, boots worn, etc. If such an
##item happens to be cursed or otherwise requires a saving throw,
##the spell caster receives all normal defenses.
##For each round the spell is in effect, there is a probability of
##15%, +5% for each caster level that one power of the item is
##discovered. If the item is powerless this information will be
##gained as well. However, when using this spell, the caster must
##succeed in a saving throw versus spells each round. Only if this
##succeeds is the information gained correct. If the save is failed
##by 5% (1 lower than the target number) the information gained
##is false, to be determined by the referee. If the roll is failed by
##more than that, no information is gained. Note that while
##specific abilities or powers are revealed, the specific "+" of a
##weapon is not, only the fact that it is enchanted is revealed and
##a general sense of whether it is strong or weak. The specific
##number of charges, if relevant, contained in a magic item is not
##revealed. Knowledge of an approximation is granted, which will
##be in the form of a range above and below approximately 25%
##of the actual number.
##This spell is very draining on the caster. The caster suffers
##temporary loss of 8 points to CON when the spell duration
##ends. If this should bring the caster to fewer than 3, he falls
##unconscious for 24 hours but awakens with full CON restored.
##Points of CON may only be restored at the rate of 1 per 6 turns
##of rest.

##Massmorph
##Level: 4
##Duration: Until dispelled
##Range: 240'
##Up to 100 human-sized or equivalent creatures are given the illusory
##appearance of a forest. Any creatures that enter such an enchanted area become
##part of the illusion. Likewise, any creatures that leave the affected area
##become visible for what they are. This spell can be dismissed by the caster at
##any time.

##Extend Duration I
##Level: 4
##Duration: Special
##Range: 0
##This spell may be used to extend the duration of a spell the
##caster has already cast and is still in effect. Only spells of levels
##1, 2, and 3 are extended in this way, and their duration is
##extended by 50%.
##Extend Duration II
##Level: 5
##Duration: Special
##Range: 0
##Extend duration II is identical to extend duration I, except that
##the duration of spells from levels 1-4 may be extended by 50%.
##Extend Duration III
##Level: 6
##Duration: Special
##Range: 0
##Extend duration III is identical to extend duration I, except that
##the duration of spells of levels 1-3 may be extended by 100%,
##and spells of levels 4 and 5 may be extended by 50%.

##False Gold
##Level: 2
##Duration: 6 turns per level
##Range: 10'
##The caster may transform copper or brass within 1 cubic foot
##per level into pure gold. This is the equivalent of 400 pounds
##per cubic foot, and the metal could be in the form of coins, art,
##etc. Beings that encounter false gold can check to see if the ruse
##is detected, by rolling 1d20 against INT. A penalty of +1 is
##added to the roll per level of the caster. So if a shopkeeper has
##an INT of 12 and the caster is 5th level, a roll of 7 or less is
##required to detect the false nature of the gold. Alternatively, if
##the gold makes contact with pure iron there is a 20% chance it
##reverts back to its true nature.
##
##False Trap
##Level: 2
##Duration: 6 turns per level
##Range: 10'
##This clever enchantment may be used by the caster to
##permanently create the false perception that an item, such as a
##small box, lock, dagger, etc., is trapped. If the thief skill detect
##traps is employed on the item, there is an 80% chance, -4% per
##level of the observer, that a trap is perceived. If an attempt is
##made to remove the trap, there is a slim 20% chance, +4% per
##level of the observer, that the trap is perceived to be removed.

##Vanish
##Level: 7
##Duration: Special
##Range: Touch
##The caster may teleport an object as per the spell teleport, or may banish an
##object to the ethereal plane, in which case the object is replaced in the
##material plane with stone that matches the objects shape.  If the spell dispel
##magic is cast upon a stone item replaced by this spell, it may bring back the
##original item.

##Distort Distance
##Level: 5
##Duration: 1 turn per level
##Range: 10' per level
##This spell is cast after an earth elemental has been summoned.
##The elemental will then obey, and spread itself over an area
##specified by the caster, up to 1,000 square feet per caster level.
##The area can be distorted to be twice long or equally short.
##Thus a 500' long x 200' wide cavern could be shrunk to 250'
##long x 100' wide, or expanded to 1000' long x 400' wide.
##Creatures traveling over such a distorted area do not realize it is
##distorted, and there is no way to detect any outside influence.
##The area will faintly radiate magic.

##Scribe
##Level: 1
##Duration: 1 hour per level
##Range: 0
##Allows caster to copy a spell into his spell book, even if it is of a level
##the caster cannot use, and even if the spell is unusable due to intelligence.
##The scribing takes 1 hour per spell level of the spell transferred. For the
##time the spell is written, the caster is in a deep state of concentration, and
##will always be surprised. The caster must succeed in a saving throw versus
##spells. A penalty of -1 is applied if the spell to be copied is 3 levels
##greater than the caster may use, and a bonus of +2 is granted if the spell is
##up to 1 level greater than the caster may use, or below. If this saving throw
##is unsuccessful, the caster suffers 1d4 damage per spell level of the
##spell to be scribed, and the strain forces the caster unconscious for an equal
##number of turns. The caster may only heal up to 4 hp per day of this damage.

##Magic Aura
##Level: 1
##Duration: 1 day per level
##Range: Touch
##The caster may alter an item's aura so that it registers to detect
##spells (and spells with similar capabilities) as though it were
##magical. If the object bearing magic aura is physically examined
##(touched), the examiner recognizes that the aura is false if he
##succeeds in a saving throw versus spells. Otherwise, he believes
##the aura and no amount of testing reveals what the true magic
##is.
