#By means of this spell, a cleric or magic-user can
#animate a statue for a period of time equal to
#1d10 rounds plus the caster’s level.
#The statue will only respond to the verbal com-
#mands of its creator. Although the exact hit dice
#are subject to the material of the statue, it is sug-
#gested that the Referee use the Animated Statues
#(Crystal, Stone, and Iron) presented in the Laby-
#rinth Lord Core Rulebook (p.98) as base guide-
#lines.
#Statue Move AC HD #AT DMG
#Crystal 90’(30’) 4 3 2 1d6x2
#Stone 60’(20’) 4 5 2 2d6x2
#Iron 30’(10’) 4 4 2 1d8x2
#Note that if the caster dies while the golem is still
#animated, it will go berserk and attack a random
#target.

#Vitharia's Vengeful Visage
#Level: 2
#Duration: See below
#Range: 0
#This spell functions as a lesser version of the 4th
#level magic-user spell Fear.
#This spell creates an illusion that deforms the face
#of the caster (or accentuates a pre-existing de-
#formity) and inspires terror in living humanoid crea-
#tures within an invisible cone (5' wide origin, 20'
#long, and 15' diameter at the terminal end).
#Those who behold the Vengeful Visage panic and
#flee from fear of the caster if they fail their saving
#throw (Spells). Victims flee from the caster as fast
#as their movement rate allows, for a number of
#rounds equal to half the caster's level (rounded
#up). This spell has no effect on blind creatures or
#creatures of 4 or greater hit dice.
#Vitharia was a young elven magic-user of great
#promise who was defaced when pummeled in
#the street by thugs.
#He was later bludgeoned and eaten by a mimic.
