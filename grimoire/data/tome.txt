##Tomes and Schools of Magic
##One aspect of the idea of tomes of spells which bears discussion is in
##how it relates to the concept of “schools of magic”. The assumption in
##this book is that many types or schools of magic exist, each studying the
##arcane techniques to give power over a certain aspect of reality. Magic-
##users using the standard spell list (sometimes also known as mages) are
##generalists, focussing largely on magic of invocation and transmutation,
##but also studying a smattering of many other types of magic, without
##delving deeply into any one. On the other hand, each type of specialist
##magic-user (i.e. the illusionist, elementalist, necromancer and vivimancer)
##studies a single school of magic which has minimal overlap with the
##other schools.

##The Book of Deceptions

##The Book of Meta-Magic
##Recommended for use by: Magic-users
##Aside from the ever-popular dispel magic, the study of meta-magic – that
##is spells with the power to manipulate other spells – is usually only
##pursued by arch-mages and academics. This tome contains a selection of
##the kind of spells which might be found in the possession of such
##wizards.
##One especially interesting use of the spells in this tome would be in a
##campaign based around a magic academy, where all the PCs are magic-
##users of various types, and their primary enemies are the wizards of a
##rival guild.

Arcane Mark
Level: 1
Duration: Permanent
Range: Touch

another mage, save negates.  The charmed spell will not willingly harm the

Spell Reading
Level: 2
Duration: 1 turn per level
Range: 60'

they have memorized. It takes one round of scanning to detect the overall

Range: 0
Modifies a second spell (which must be cast in the following round), causing

chosen – some examples of suitable triggers are: blowing out a candle,
speaking a single word, drawing a weapon.

Dweomerlight
Level: 3
Duration: 6 turns
Range: 60'
Causes all memorized spells and all spells cast within range to glow in
a variety of scintillating colours.  Spell casters' heads will be surrounded by a halo
of rainbow hues, while spells actually cast produce vivid streaks of light,
making the target and the source unquestionable.  The manifested colours
broadly allow specific spells to be identified.

Command Spell
Level: 4
Duration: Instantaneous
Range: 60'
Similar |Charm Spell|_, this spell enables caster to cause a spell to cast
itself immediately, save negates.  The caster has complete control over the

Range: Self
When memorized, this spell causes the mental energy patterns of all other
memorized spells to be encoded in a bizarre and mindbending cypher. Affording
complete protection from magic which can affect memorized spells.
The presence of the encrypted formulae presents a forces anyone reading the
caster's mind by any means, to save or be affected by |Confusion|_ for 1d6
rounds.  Additionally, the obfuscated spells are so unusual in their
manifestation that all mages take a -2 penalty to any saves against the spells
and there is a slight chance of penetrating a Shield of Magic.

Spying Sigil
Level: 4
Duration: Special
Range: Touch
Inserts a tiny inconspicuous sigil into the text of an arcane formulae which
is is undetectable by visual examination. If the spell in which the sigil has
been placed is memorized by a the sigil is implanted into the mage's mind.  As
long as the sigil remains in the target's mind, its creator is aware and able
to see through the target's eyes and hear through the target's ears and the
target is -4 to saves against ESP, Charm, Suggestion, etc. cast by the creator.
The sigil remains active until the spell it was memorized with is cast.

Steal Spell
Level: 5
Duration: Special
Range: 60'
Effects the transference of the mental energy pattern of a single memorized
spell from the mind of the target into that of the caster, save negates. The

unaffected.

Range: Touch
Causes a single small object to become invisible and be replaced with an
illusionary duplicate hidden in a different location within 30'.  If the
illusionary object is discovered and touched, it disappears and is replaced

discovery and duplication continues for the spell's duration.  If at any time
the real object is touched or moved, the spell ends.

Hapless Fool
Level: 2
Duration: 1 turn
Range: 30'
Once within the spell's duration, the caster may cloak a single action with an
illusion.  The cloaked action is made to appear to all observers like
a slapstick accident. Thus, witnesses may perceive a murder victim to slip and
fall on his own blade, or a stolen item may seem to fall into the sack of an
unaware passer-by.
On-lookers are allowed a save to detect that all is not as it seems, though
only the most eagle-eyed will see completely through the illusion and perceive
what really occurred.

Phantasm of the Laughing Gnome
Level: 3
Duration: 1 hour per level
Range: 60'
Conjures an illusionary gnome which will follow the chosen target around for
the duration.  Due to its unreal nature the gnome cannot be harmed in any way,
and cannot be outrun or evaded, even by teleportation magic.
The gnome can have one of several effects, chosen at the time of casting.
**Jovial gnome**: acts as a friendly and good-spirited companion, making jokes
and pranks and generally trying to lift the spirits of the being it follows.
**Boisterous gnome**: apparently horrendously drunk, makes a huge amount of
noise as it follows its target.  **Sneering gnome**: This gnome's humour is
cynical and bitter, always trying to ridicule and degrade its target.
Note that this spell does not allow a saving throw, as the words and actions
of the gnome have an effect regardless of whether the target realises it
is an illusion or not.

Slapstick Fun!
Level: 3
Duration: 1 round per level
Range: 60'
Cast upon an area, this odd illusion disguises any acts of violence occurring
within as boisterous rough-and-tumble. In this manner, dangerous weapons are
disguised as harmless and acts of violence or even killing are likewise veiled
in a comedic manner.
Any onlooker who has reason to doubt the reality of what he or she is
perceiving is allowed a save to see through the illusion.

##The Chronomancer's Workbook
##Recommended for use by: Magic-users
##One of the most obscure, mysterious and esoteric branches of the arcane
##is the study of chronomancy – spells which manipulate time in various
##ways. The 9th level spell time stop is a commonly known spell of this
##type. This tome contains a trio of spells of an unusual nature which deal
##with the manipulation of time.

Pre-emptive Strike
Level: 2
Duration: 1 round
Range: 0
The first time the caster is attacked they (and they only) gain a "bonus"
round. This additional round occurs before any attack that triggered it,
giving the caster a chance, before anyone else can act, to attack, cast
spells, etc. The caster does not even need to be aware of the attack for the
spell to warp time. The spell auto casts.

Undo
Level: 4
Duration: Permanent
Range: 120'
A more advanced and lesser-known variant of |Dispel Magic|_, this spell is able
to manipulate time and can dispel any spell cast in the previous round,
including spells of instantaneous duration.

Zoetrope
Level: 9
Duration: Permanent
Range: 10'
This powerful spell creates an area of space where time is warped so
tightly that a single moment is repeated over and over for all eternity.
The area affected is a cylinder 10' high and 10' in diameter. Any
creatures or objects in this area when the spell is cast, or anything
subsequently entering the area is caught in the time loop. From the
outside, the time loop appears to be a spinning column of light, wherein
can be seen, semi-transparent and phantom-like, the last few seconds of
normal existence of everything trapped inside.
The Zoetrope is an extremely powerful dweomer, and is unaffected by
|Dispel Magic|_. A |Wish|_ is sufficient to release a single creature or object
from its confines, but if magic ever existed which could undo this spell
entirely, it is now lost.
The casting of this spell carries a certain risk to the chronomancer, who
has a 10% chance of accidentally being sucked into the zoetrope and
trapped.

##The Dimensional Treatise
##Recommended for use by: Magic-users

##objects into the smallest possible space. The objects to be packed must

##objects worn or held by creatures. As the spell is completed the affected
##objects are teleported instantaneously into a neatly packed cuboid. At the
##caster's option objects may be packed inside a container of suitable size,
##effectively increasing its carrying capacity by one third.

Brings about a bizarre modification of the laws of force and movement within
a bounded area, causing all objects and creatures in the affected area to
enter eagerly into a state of rapid spinning. In the first round of the

falling and of losing control of their momentum.  Spinning creatures suffer -4
to attacks in the first round. Most other actions, including spell casting,
are impossible.  From the second round of onwards, all actions are impossible,
