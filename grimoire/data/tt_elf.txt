##Fey Elf
##The elf class in the core Referee rules functions essentially as a
##multi-classed fighter/magic-user. They can use any weapons and armour
##exactly as a fighter, and can learn and cast spells exactly as a magic-user.
##This type of elf is now a classic trope of fantasy role-playing.
##Some Referees may, however, desire something a bit different.
##Presented in this chapter are some ideas for adding a bit of fairy tale
##magic to elves, to give them a different flavour and different spell-casting
##abilities than that of the standard magic-user.
##The Fey Dimension
##The primary concept in this re-imagining of the elf is that they are
##beings from another world – a place known as the fey dimension. This
##“other world" is a common feature of folk tales, where it is often seen as
##the dwelling place of many supernatural beings, including elves, pixies,
##sprites, goblins, brownies, and so on.
##The fey dimension, sometimes also known as “faerie", exists in parallel
##to the world of men. The two worlds have a separate and independent
##existence, but magical portals allow transit between the two. Such
##portals are generally common knowledge for the natives of the fey
##dimension, who may enter the world of mortals for their own mysterious
##purposes, and sometimes simply to cause mischief. Humans, on the
##other hand, are usually not party to the knowledge of where doorways to
##the fey world lie, and how they can be used. Mortals are usually only
##able to enter the fey realm by accident or when kidnapped or lured inside
##by fey creatures.
##Inside the fey dimension time flows in a manner which has little in
##common with its behaviour in the everyday world, having more in
##common with the nature of dreams. After what seems like a short
##sojourn into the other world, people may return to find that in fact years
##have passed. The opposite is also possible. This is the classic stuff of
##fairy tales.
##The nature of the fey dimension, and what role it plays in a campaign, is
##left for each Referee to determine. It could exist simply as a
##conceptual background for fey elf characters, or it could take a larger
##role, with adventures and intrigues spanning the two worlds.
##Fey Elves
##As natives of this other world, fey elves differ somewhat from the typical
##Referee elf. Physically they are tall, thin and ephemeral, and
##always have one or more unusual features that mark them as obviously
##non-human, such as: pointed ears, silver or violet hair, cat-like eyes,
##sharp pointed teeth, extra fingers, etc. They are of very diverse
##appearance.
##In common with all creatures of the fey dimension, fey elves have a
##fickle, whimsical and somewhat mischievous nature. They enjoy music
##and song, as well as fine food and drink – but all their pleasures have a
##strange otherworldly quality, which other races can find both intoxicating
##and eerie.
##Fey elves are typically Neutral in alignment, having goals and morals
##which are somewhat unfathomable to mortal races, and which often
##transcend human concepts of good and evil.
##Fey Elves as Adventurers
##Fey elf adventurers may use as a basis either the elf class as presented in
##Referee or the elf race from the Advanced Edition Companion.
##The following modifications apply:
##• Fey elves can speak their alignment language, common, elvish,
##pixie and goblin.
##• Fey elves can unfailingly identify doorways between the world
##of men and the fey dimension. This ability does not allow
##them to detect such doorways automatically – it must be used
##actively when examining a portal.
##Further differences are discussed in the following sections.
##Fey Elf Class (Basic Referee)
##A fey elf adventurer compatible with basic Referee has a different
##method of spell-casting to the standard elf, and use a different list of
##spells. These differences are explained below.
##Additionally, while they are innately magical, fey elves lack the wizardly
##training required to use scrolls.
##Fey Elf Race (Advanced Referee)
##Players who are using the additional rules in the Advanced Edition
##Companion may use the elf race.
##Apart from the differences in known languages, and their ability to
##identify portals to the fey dimension (as described above), fey elves
##function in the same way as the standard elf race. They are able to
##choose any of the standard classes available to elves, with the normal
##restrictions on level advancement. They may however additionally
##choose the sorcerer class – a new class, described below, which is only
##available to members of the fey race.
##Sorcerer
##Requirements: None
##Prime Requisite: INT
##Hit Dice: 1d4
##Maximum Level: 10
##This class is for use with the fey elf race, as described above.
##The sorcerer class is a distinct type of spell-caster, whose spells focus on
##magic of nature and trickery. Their magic is innate, rather than learned
##by arduous study or granted by a deity, and thus usually only fey races
##are allowed to take this class.
##Sorcerers cast spells in a unique manner, as described in the following
##section on fey spell-casting. They have a special spell progression table
##and spell list, also detailed below.
##Although they do not study magic, sorcerers have an intuitive mastery of
##arcane forces and are able to use all magic items available to magic-
##users, with the exception of scrolls.
##Due to the innate nature of a sorcerer's magic, his spells are not
##hampered by armour, and do not require any gestures or words, being
##manifested with a mere twinkling of the eye. Members of this class are
##able to wear studded leather armour or lesser, and can use the following
##weapons: club, light crossbow, dagger, dart, quarterstaff, shortbow, sling,
##short sword.
##They have the same saving throw, to hit and experience advancement as
##magic-users.

##Fey Spell-Casting
##Characters of the fey elf or sorcerer classes cast spells according to the
##spell progression chart shown below, and gain spells from their own
##special spell list which focuses on magic of nature and trickery. This list
##contains spells in common with druids, illusionists and magic-users, with
##the addition of a few new spells, unique to fey, which are described in
##this chapter.
##Their manner of spell casting also differs from that of other spell-using
##classes. The spell progression chart represents both the number of spells
##a fey elf can cast per day, and also the number of spells he or she
##knows. For example, a 1st level fey spell-caster knows two 1st level
##spells, which can be cast once per day each.
##As fey elves are naturally magical they do not need to pray or study
##books to be able to use their spells. Fey spell-casters regain their spells
##automatically after a night's rest. Upon gaining an experience level, fey
##automatically learn any new spells allowed to them, without requiring
##any additional study or training of any kind.
##Fey spell-casters' known spells are determined randomly from their spell
##list. This determination can be made in two ways, as the Referee
##wishes.
##• Firstly, the character's known spells may be rolled for initially
##at character creation, and whenever a new experience level is
##gained. Once the character's spell selection has been
##determined it remains fixed, until the character again increases
##in level and gains new spells.
##• Alternatively, for an added touch of chaos, the character's
##spells may be re-rolled every day or every game session.

##Fey Spells

##Dimension Leap
##Level: 1
##Duration: Instantaneous
##Range: 20', +5' per two levels
##Upon completion of this spell, the caster vanishes from existence, only
##to reappear in another location at the start of the following round. The
##destination of the dimension leap must be somewhere within range and
##within the caster's line of sight from his location when casting the spell.
##When leaping to a location adjacent to an enemy, the caster can choose
##to make an additional melee attack, due to surprise. This extra attack is
##made out of the normal initiative sequence, and the caster may also take
##his normal action in the same round.

##Invisibility, Limited
##Level: 1
##Duration: 1d6 rounds, +1 round per level
##Range: 0
##Aside from its brief duration, this spell has an identical effect to the 2nd
##level invisibility spell.

##Summon Fey Kin
##Level: 1
##Duration: 6 turns
##Range: 30'
##This spell enables the caster to summon a variety of creatures from fey
##dimensions. The creatures which may be summoned depend on the
##caster's level, and the type of environment in which the spell is cast.
##A single creature is summoned by this spell, and it is not in any way
##bound to obey the caster – the Referee should make a normal
##reaction roll to determine its demeanour toward the summoner.
##Summoned creatures carry any weapons which are noted in their
##monster description.
##Summon fey kin, creatures by environment
##Creature Environment Level
##Brownie Sylvan forest or plains 1
##Fey goblin* Underground 1
##Leprechaun Sylvan forest or plains 1
##Nixie Large body of water 1
##Pixie Any 1
##Sprite Sylvan forest 1
##Dryad Sylvan forest 3
##Nymph Sylvan forest 5
##Satyr Sylvan forest 7
##Treant Sylvan forest 9
##* Described in Appendix II.

##Teleport (Fey)
##Level: 5
##Duration: Instantaneous
##Range: 10'
##This spell functions in the same way as the magic-user teleport spell,
##with the one difference that the caster can teleport himself into any very
##familiar location in the fey dimension without any risk of error. It can
##thus be used as a fail-safe means of escape for a fey spell-caster.
