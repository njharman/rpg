## TT Illusionist

Memorium
Level: 5
Duration: Special
Range: Special
Cast in a location where a specific event is known to have occurred, the
caster and up to one companion per two levels are drawn into a vision,
re-experiencing the event in question.  In the vision the caster and his
companions take on the perspectives of individuals who were present at the
historic event, perceiving what happened directly from the point of view of
those involved.

Dream Travel
Level: 7
Duration: Special
Range: Special
Conjures a semi-real large vehicle of some kind, typically a mighty sailing
ship, which the illusionist and up to 100 others are taken onto. The caster
must be conscious in order to cast the spell, but all others must be asleep.
The spell lasts as long as the caster remains awake and the passengers remain
asleep.
The passengers enter a shared dream of travelling aboard the conjured vessel
through an imaginary landscape, and may act as if awake, typically aiding in
the operations of the ship.  The journey usually appears to span several days,
and may sometimes even feel like weeks of travel.  The vessel is actually
moving through real space at an incredible rate -- up to 100 miles per hour
can be covered, completely unhindered by any real terrain.
In a manner similar to |Illusory Abode|_, the dream vessel
may take on a recurring appearance if the caster wishes it, and the
enhancements to |Spectral Force|_ and |Creation, Major|_ apply inside the
vessel.

Illusory Abode
Level: 8
Duration: 1 hour per level
Range: 30'
Conjures the image of a door or trapdoor in a nearby surface.  Inside the door
is an illusionary house or castle of some kind, providing the opportunity of
rest and respite for all who enter.
The exact appearance, dimensions and characteristics of the illusory
abode are under the caster's complete control. The illusory abode exists
in a strange half-dimension, and is thus unaffected by environmental
conditions in the area where the door is located.
The caster can create illusory inhabitants and stuff by use of further spells.
Within the confines of the illusory abode, all illusions created by the caster
become partially real, and gain the ability to manipulate and affect physical
objects. Furthermore, any illusions of permanent duration created inside the
illusory abode will appear each time the caster returns.
Guests can enter and leave at will, but creatures that are not invited inside
by the caster cannot enter by any means.  When the spell's duration comes to
an end, the caster and all guests appear back at the location where the door
was created.

Figment
Level: 8
Duration: Permanent
Range: 10'
Causes a single target to be stricken with powerful shadow magic which causes
them to gradually fade out of existence, no save. The first day after the
spell is cast, the target feels weak of body and feeble of mind.  The second
day, the target becomes semi-corporeal.  The third day, the victim is a mere
shade, unable to interact with the real world, and barely able to make
a sound. After four days, the victim disappears entirely, being taken into an
obscure shadowy plane where they will wander endlessly.  The caster is able to
cancel the spell at any time.

Pathless Land
Level: 8
Duration: Special
Range: Special
This powerful illusion takes two forms, one a permanent protection for
the caster's home or other secret location, and one a short-lived
impediment to pursuit.
The permanent version affects up to a mile radius which takes on a shifting,
maze-like appearance.  The exact effects are dependant on the terrain in the
enchanted area, for example: trees and bushes may seem to grow into
bewildering twisting pathways, rock ridges may form a maze, or boggy ground
may form an unnavigable series of paths. The maze created is purely
illusionary, but its effects are so powerful that it becomes virtually
impossible to navigate for anyone except the caster and those whom he chooses
to grant access to.
The short-lived version of this spell creates a similar maze, in an
area of up to 20' radius per level of the caster, and having a duration of one
hour. During this time, any creatures entering the area become lost as per
|Maze|_.
This spell is not susceptible to dispelling by anything less than |Wish|_ or
|Alter Reality|_.

Solid Fog
Level: 4
Duration: 1 turn per level
Range: 120'
Conjures a large bank of fog filling a 20' cube per caster level. Which can
only be dissipated by extremely strong wind or powerful fire magic. In
addition to blocking vision beyond 2', the cloying vapours limit wind,
movement, and missile/spell ranges to 1/10th normal.

Time Flow (reversible)
Level: 5
Duration: 6 turns per level
Range: 10'
This powerful illusion warps the flow of time at the location where it is
cast, causing each turn that passes to have the subjective effect of a
whole hour.
The reversed version of the spell causes the perception of time to be
reduced by six times within the affected area – one hour of real time
passes in what appears to be merely one turn.

Upper Hand
Level: 6
Duration: 6 turns per level
Range: 0
This spell creates the convincing illusion that the caster is accompanied
by a band of followers, taking whatever general form the caster desires.
The group of companions is dynamic and will adapt its number and
volume so as to always appear to be a slightly larger or more formidable
force than any observing opposition. Thus, an illusionist ambushed by a
group of brigands may appear to be protected by a slightly larger band of
knights, while an illusionist encountering an army poised for war may
appear to be in command of a slightly larger or better equipped force.
If any of the illusionary companions is touched, it will dissipate
immediately, giving the game away. Otherwise the companions are
perfectly convincing, moving as a force of the appropriate size, making
appropriate (if generic) sounds, and giving off an appropriate smell.

Phantasm of Forgetting
Level: 7
Duration: Instantaneous
Range: 60'
This insidious spell causes a single target to forget everything about their
life and to completely lose their sense of identity, save negates. The
target's memories are still present, but only powerful mind-reading magic is
able to access the veiled memories.

Dreaming
Level: 6
Duration: Sleep
Range: Unlimited
Caster falls into a sleep-like trance and is able to enter into the target's
dream world.  If the target is awake when the spell is cast, then the caster
simply remains in a vaguely unconscious state until the spell's duration has
expired.
Once inside the target's dream world, the caster can observe the dreams
which are occurring, and is also able to interact with the dream world
and the mind of the sleeping individual.
Various ends can be achieved by intruding in someone's dreams, for
example: conversation, relaying messages, gaining information, or even
psychological torment. The spell is of sufficient potency that the caster is
able to completely dominate the content of the target's dreams, if he so
desires.

Viral Meme
Level: 9
Duration: Special
Range: 60'
Cast initially upon one or more targets within 60', this spell implants,
modifies or removes a single concept, belief or memory from the minds of those
affected, save at -4 negates.  Anyone who comes into contact with one infected
with meme must save at -4, or also become affected. Thus the phantasm can
spread very rapidly and soon overrun whole populations.

Weird
Level: 9
Duration: 1 round per level
Range: 5' per level
Similar to |Phantasmal Killer|_, except that it affects all creatures in range
(with the exception of the caster, who may simply observe the effects). The
phantasmal nemeses created attack as monsters of half the caster's level.

Alter Reality
Level: 9
Duration: Special
Range: Unlimited
The pinnacle of the illusionist's art, enables the caster to bring forth into
reality whatever he can imagine. It works in the same way as |Wish|_. The one
difference is that an illusionist must first create an image of what he wishes
to become reality, using other spells of illusion. He must then cast Alter
Reality, which causes the created illusion to become absolutely and
irrevocably real.

Mists of Madness
Level: 9
Duration: 1 turn per level
Range: Special
Conjures a vast roiling bank of impenetrable fog, expanding at a rate of 30'
per round up to a maximum radius of 600'. This fog blocks **all** forms of vision
beyond 10'.
Apart from the caster, who is immune, all creatures within the fog are subject
to the effects of |Maze|_ and must save once per turn or suffer |Confusion|_,
|Feeblemind|_, insanity, or the like due to the nightmarish visions and
phantasms they perceive.

##Doppelganger
##Level: 1
##Duration: 2d6 rounds, + 2 rounds per level
##Range: 0
##The illusion must take the appearance of a humanoid, not taller or shorter
##than the caster by more than 1', but apparent weight and clothing or items may
##be altered in any way.
