Detect Magic
Level: 1
Duration: Permanent
Range: Touch
Draw pentagram, place item within (caster may not touch it), rub live blessed
chicken(5sp) on object, chop chicken head off and watch it run around.  If it
falls onto its left side item is magical, amount of blood equals power of
item. Those very gifted with divination or long experienced can divine
specific abilities of item by evaluating the pattern of blood left by chicken
(caster level squared + d100 >= 100).  Other sacrifices may be more effective,
less effective, or dangerous.  Chickens work so people keep using them.  Also,
they taste good roasted up afterwards.

**Warning:** Be ready for what evil and/or cursed items will do to your
chicken.

save 1/2. Unless magically protected from fire, the object on which the runes
were written is obliterated.  The caster and any other beings specifically
instructed can read the protected writing without triggering the runes.
A magic-user has a 10% chance per level of detecting the runes, and if
detected may bypass them with same chance as dispelling magic.  Failure sets
off runes.

16 pawns of Viz and 1000sp gem.
The caster calls a previously prepared nonliving item from virtually any
location directly to his hand.  Casting Instant Summons places a magical mark
on the item and magically and invisibly inscribes the name of the item on the
prepared gem. Thereafter, the caster can summon the item (and crush the gem)
by speaking a special word.  Only the caster can use the gem in this way.  The
item can be summoned from another plane.

Duration: Permanent until banished
Range: 120'

Level: 5
Duration: Permanent
Range: 0
Expend 25 pawns of Viz.
Creates a pseudo-duplicate of any creature out of snow and ice form, and some
piece of the creature to be duplicated (hair, nail, or the like) must be
placed inside the snow or ice. The simulacrum appears to be the same as the
original, but it has only one-half of the real creature's hit points. The
duplicate has a faulty memory of the original's life, but will remember most
details 30% of the time. At all times the simulacrum remains under the
caster's absolute command. Although, no special telepathic link exists.  If
destroyed, a simulacrum reverts to snow and ice.  A simulacrum will radiate
magic and |True Seeing|_ will reveal it for what it is.

Contact Other Plane
Level: 6
Duration: Special
Range: Self
Expend 36 pawns of Viz.
The caster creates a mental contact with the planes, forces, powers, and
geometries of the beyond, in order to gain answers.  The caster must concentrate
on maintaining the ritual in order to ask questions and receive answers at the
rate of one per round.  Questions are answered with "yes", "no", "maybe",
"never", "irrelevant", or some other one-word answer.
The greater the number of questions asked the deeper into the planes of
existence the caster delves.  The depth determines chance that the knowledge
is available at that level, the chance of receiving a correct answer, and the
chance that the caster will become temporarily insane from the experience.
Temporary insanity lasts for as many weeks as the “number” of the plane where
the caster's sanity failed… or perhaps was deliberately removed.  The base
chance indicated on the table is reduced by 1 for every level the caster is
above 9.

Legend Lore
Level: 6
Duration: Special
Range: Self
Expend 36 pawns of Viz.
Legend lore reveals legends about an important person, place, or thing.  If
the person or thing is at hand, or if the caster is in the place in question,
the casting time is d8 hours. If the caster has detailed information on the
target the casting time is d10 days.  Otherwise it takes d100 days. During the
casting, the caster cannot engage in other than routine activities: eating,
sleeping, and so forth.  If the person, place, or thing is not of legendary
importance, no information is gained.

Spiritwrack
Level: 6
Duration: Special
Range: 60'
Expend 36 pawns of Viz and gems, see below.
By using the blood of a demon or devil combined with powdered gems equal to
100sp per HD of the intended victim the caster scribes a scroll used to
torture an infernal being, powerful vampire or lich. No save if the target's
name is known.

When the scroll is read, the victim is held in place and can take no actions.
After 1 turn, the victim is in absolute agony and loses 1 hp per HD. After
2 turns, it loses half its HP. One more turn and it is propelled back to its
home plane, imprisoned there for 1 year per caster level.  This spell is often
used to extort something from its victim, and may be stopped at any time short
of imprisonment.

Summon Weather
Level: 6
Duration: 4d12 hours
Range: several miles
Expend 36 pawns of Viz.
As Zealot Spell |Control Weather|_.

Summon Demon
Level: 7
Duration: Special
Range: 10'
Expend 666 pawns of Viz.
This complicated ritual requires a circle of protection for the caster, and
a pentacle-bound area of imprisonment for the demon to be constructed with
various magical markings and candles.  The summoning takes 1 turn per HD of
the demon. Demons are allowed a save to resist the summoning.  The Summon
Demon spell creates a binding pact on any agreement made between demon and
caster.  After any service is performed, the demon is propelled back to its
home plane. There is a base 5% chance that the bargaining is grossly
mishandled, setting the demon loose to wreak vengeance on the caster. This
chance is lowered by 1% per caster level above 15.

Trap the Soul
Level: 7
Duration: Permanent
Range: 10'
Expend 49 pawns of Viz and a gem, see below.
Forces a creature's life force (and its material body) into a gem. Which holds
the trapped entity until the gem is broken, releasing the life force  and
allowing the material body to reform.  Requires gem of at least 1,000sp value
per HD of the creature to be trapped. The trap can be triggered in
one of two ways.
**Spell Completion:** completed by speaking its final word as a standard
action as if one were casting a regular spell. Save negates and shatters the
gem.
**Trigger Object:** The second method is far more insidious.  Both the
creature's name and the trigger word must be inscribed on the trigger object.
As soon as the target picks up or accepts the trigger object, its life force
is automatically transferred to the gem without the benefit of a saving throw.

Astral Projection
Level: 7
Duration: Special
Range: Touch
Expend pawns of Viz equal to the square of each target's level.
Projects the astral forms of up to seven willing creatures linked in a circle at the
time of the casting. Leaving their physical bodies behind in a state of
suspended animation. Fellow travelers are dependent upon the caster and must
accompany him at all times.  If something happens to the caster during the
journey, his companions are stranded.  Since the astral plane touches upon
other planes, the caster may enter them, forming a new physical body on the
plane of existence entered.  While on the astral plane, the astral body is
connected at all times to the physical body by a silvery cord.  When a second
body is formed on a different plane, the incorporeal silvery cord remains
invisibly attached to the new body. If the second body or the astral form is
slain, the cord simply returns to the body where it rests on the material
plane, thereby reviving it from its state of suspended animation.  If the cord
is broken, the caster is killed, astrally and physically. Luckily, very few
things can destroy a silver cord.  The projection lasts until the caster desires it
to end, or until it is terminated by some outside means.
