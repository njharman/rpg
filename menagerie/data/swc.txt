##Not a lot of detail is given about the monsters, because the
##more detail given, the more your own mental image of the
##fantasy world is going to be locked into a single track. We are
##not going to say that giant ants are red, nocturnal, three feet long,
##and fond of eating Elves, because in your mind, they might be
##blue, diurnal, five feet long, and eat only plants unless they are
##attacked. Details about monsters toss roadblocks in front of your
##imagination. Yes, details can also inspire the imagination, but we
##are making the assumption that if you are interested in fantasy
##gaming in the first place, you have a good imagination that does
##not need details about the size of a giant ant.

##About Magic Resistance:
##One of the “Special” items that may be listed for some
##creatures is “Magic Resistance,” followed by a percentage. The
##given percentage chance is the likelihood that any magic used
##against the creature (other than bonuses from weapons) will fail
##to take effect. Roll d100 and if the result is less than the given
##percentage, the magic will fail.

Ant, Giant (Worker)
Hit Dice: 2
Armor Class: 3 [16]
Attacks: Bite (1d6 + poison)
Saving Throw: 16
Special: None
Move: 18
Alignment: Neutrality
Challenge Level/XP: 2/30
Giant ants live in vast subterranean hives tunneled through soil and
even stone. A hive can hold as many as 100 ants, in a worker-to-warrior
ratio of 1:5. A hive also contains one giant queen ant.
Ant, Giant (Warrior)
Hit Dice: 3
Armor Class: 3 [16]
Attacks: Bite (1d6 + poison)
Saving Throw: 14
Special: None
Move: 18
Alignment: Neutrality
Challenge Level/XP: 2/30
Giant ants live in vast subterranean hives tunneled through soil and even
stone. A hive can hold as many as 100 ants, in a worker-to-warrior ratio
of 1:5. The poison of a warrior ant does 2d6 points of damage if a saving
throw is failed, 1d4 points of damage if the saving throw succeeds.
Ant, Giant (Queen)
Hit Dice: 10
Armor Class: 3 [16]
Attacks: Bite (1d6)
Saving Throw: 5
Special: None
Move: 3
Alignment: Neutrality
Challenge Level/XP: 8/800
Giant ants live in vast subterranean hives tunneled through soil and
even stone. The queen of a giant ant colony is larger, tougher, and
slower than the average giant ant.
Badger, Giant
Hit Dice: 3
Armor Class: 4 [15]
Attacks: 2 claws (1d3), bite (1d6)
Saving Throw: 14
Special: None
Move: 6
Alignment: Neutrality
Challenge Level/XP: 3/120
These subterranean predators are the size of a full-grown human, and
quite aggressive when defending their territory.
Banshee
Hit Dice: 7
Armor Class: 0 [19]
Attacks: Claw (1d8)
Saving Throw: 9
Special: See below
Move: 6
Alignment: Chaos
Challenge Level/XP: 11/1700
Banshees are horrid undead creatures that live in swamps and other
desolate places. Banshees are only damaged by magic or silver weapons,
they have a magic resistance of 49%, and they are immune to enchantments.
Their shriek (once per day) necessitates a saving throw versus death or
the hearer will die in 2d6 rounds. One particularly unusual thing about
banshees is that they often associate with living faerie creatures of the
less savory variety; they might even be an undead form of faerie.
A Banshee can travel over water and other terrain as if it were land,
but crossing running water causes it to lose its magic resistance for 3d6
hours. Banshees look like gaunt humans (male or female) with long,
stringy hair and glowing yellow eyes. They often wear hooded cloaks.
They are considered Type 9 undead for turning purposes.
Basilisk
Hit Dice: 6
Armor Class: 4 [15]
Attacks: Bite (2d6)
Saving Throw: 11
Special: Petrifying gaze
Move: 12
Alignment: Neutrality
Challenge Level/XP: 8/800
Basilisks are great lizards whose gaze turns to stone anyone meeting
its eye. (One way of resolving this: fighting without looking incurs a -4
penalty to hit.) If the basilisk’s own gaze is reflected back at it, it has
a 10% chance to force the basilisk into a saving throw against being
turned to stone itself.
Bat, Giant Vampire
Hit Dice: 1
Armor Class: 8 [11]
Attacks: Bite (1d6)
Saving Throw: 17
Special: Sucks blood
Move: 4/18 (flying)

These bats suck blood for automatic damage of
1d6 after a successful bite. They are the size of a
falcon.
Bat, Giant
Hit Dice: 4
Armor Class: 7 [12]
Attacks: Bite (1d10)
Saving Throw: 13
Special: None
Move: 4/18 (flying)
Alignment: Neutrality
Challenge Level/XP: 5/240
These massive, man-sized cousins of the bat do not
suck blood, but nonetheless their bite can be deadly.
Bat, Giant Monster
Hit Dice: 8
Armor Class: 6 [13]
Attacks: Bite (2d8), claws (1d6)
Saving Throw: 8
Special: None
Move: 4/18 (flying)
Alignment: Neutrality unless intelligent (Chaos)
Challenge Level/XP: 9/1,100
These creatures attack with claws as well as a bite. They are twice
the size of a man, with a tremendous wingspan. Fearful peasants might
even mistake them for small dragons when the bats fly by at night.

Bear, Black
Hit Dice: 4+1
Armor Class: 7 [12]
Attacks: 2 Claws (1d3) and bite (1d6)
Saving Throw: 13
Special: Hug
Move: 9
Alignment: Neutrality
Challenge Level/XP: 4/120
If a bear hits with both claws, it hugs for an additional 1d8 hit points
of damage. Larger bears are to be found in mountains, caves, and arctic
regions, with more hit dice and inflicting more damage with the hug.

Beetle, Giant Fire
Hit Dice: 1+3
Armor Class: 4 [15]
Attacks: Bite (1d4+2)
Saving Throw: 18
Special: None
Move: 12
Alignment: Neutrality
Challenge Level/XP: 1/15
A giant fire beetle’s oily light-glands glow a reddish color. If they are removed,
they continue to give off light for 1d6 days, shedding light in a 10-foot radius.
93
monsters
Pudding, Black
Hit Dice: 10
Armor Class: 6 [13]
Attacks: Attack (3d8)
Saving Throw: 5
Special: Acidic surface, immune to cold, divides when hit with
lightning
Move: 6
Alignment: Neutrality
Challenge Level/XP: 11/1,700
Black puddings are amorphous globs with an acidic surface. They are
subterranean predators and scavengers.Any weapon or armor contacting
a black pudding will be eaten away by the acid as follows: weapon (1
hit by weapon), chain mail or lesser armor (1 hit by pudding), plate
mail (2 hits by pudding). If a weapon or armor is magical, it can take an
additional hit per magical +1 before being dissolved.
Blink Dog
Hit Dice: 4
Armor Class: 5 [15]
Attacks: Bite (1d6)
Saving Throw: 13
Special: Teleports without error
Move: 12
Alignment: Law
Challenge Level/XP: 4/240
Blink dogs are pack hunters, intelligent and usually friendly to those
who are not of evil intent. They can teleport short distances (without
error) and attack in the same turn—in most cases (75%) a blink dog will
be able to teleport behind an opponent and attack from the rear, with
appropriate bonuses.
Boar, Wild
Hit Dice: 3+3
Armor Class: 7 [12]

Saving Throw: 14
Special: Continues attacking 2 rounds after being “killed”
Move: 15
Alignment: Neutrality
Challenge Level/XP: 4/120
Wild boars continue to attack for two rounds after they reach
zero hit points before they finally drop
dead. These stats might also be used for
any similar creature that is unique to a
campaign, such as “the blue tusken-hogs
of the Ymar Plains.”
Bugbear
Hit Dice: 3+1
Armor Class: 5 [14]
Attacks: Bite (2d4) or by weapon
Saving Throw: 14
Special: Surprise opponents on a 1–3
Move: 9
Alignment: Chaos
Challenge Level/XP: 3/120
These large, hairy, goblin-like humanoids
are stealthier than their size would suggest,
almost always getting the chance to surprise
even alert opponents with a roll of 1–3 on
a d6 (50%).
Bulette
Hit Dice: 7 to 10
Armor Class: -2 [21]
Attacks: Bite (4d12) and 2 Claws (3d6)
Saving Throw: 9, 8, 6, 5
Special: Leaping, surprise
Move: 15
Alignment: Neutrality
Challenge Level/XP: 7 HD (9/1100), 8 HD (10/1400), 9 HD (11/1700), 10 HD (12/2000)
Roughly ten feet in height, a bulette (boo-LAY) is covered in natural
armor plating like that of an armadillo, and has a beak-like head that
opens to show wicked, serrated teeth. These creatures can leap to the
attack; in which case they cannot bite, but may attack with all four
claws. Bulettes dig underground to surprise their prey, leaving a furrow
in the ground as they go, caused by a dorsal crest in the creature’s armor.
These voracious hunters eat horses and halflings with gusto, although
they will devour anything from badgers to plowshares if their preferred
foods are not readily available. Although bulettes burrow, they do not
venture further underground, for they are surface predators. When the
dorsal crest of the bulette is raised (during combat this is usually only
after the thing has been wounded), the area underneath is AC 6 [13],
and this vulnerable point can be attacked if the monster is well enough
surrounded for its opponents to attack from behind as well as in front.
Carrion Creeper
Hit Dice: 2+4
Armor Class: 7 [12]
Attacks: Bite (1 hp) and 6 tentacles
Saving Throw: 14
Special: Tentacles cause paralysis
Move: 12
Alignment: Neutrality
Challenge Level/XP: 4/120
This caterpillar-like creature has 6 waving tentacles which, when they
score a hit, require the target to make a saving throw or be paralyzed
for 2d6 turns. These underground scavengers can be aggressive when
they are hungry, and will pursue prey unless distracted. They are good
climbers, but when crossing water they are unable to do much more
than float with the current.
Centaur
Hit Dice: 4
Armor Class: 5 [15] or 4 [16] with shield
Attacks: 2 kicks (1d6) and weapon
Saving Throw: 13
Special: None
Move: 18
Alignment: Any (usually Neutrality)
Challenge Level/XP: 5/240
Half man, half horse, centaurs are fierce warriors and well-known
creatures of mythology. The Referee may choose any “version” of the
centaur from myth or folklore for the campaign: some are evil, some
aloof, and some are soothsayers.
Centipede, Giant (Small, Lethal)
Hit Dice: 1d2
Armor Class: 9 [10]
Attacks: Bite (deals 0 damage)
Saving Throw: 18
Special: Lethal poison, +4 save
Move: 13
Alignment: Neutrality
Challenge Level/XP: 2/30
Lethal giant centipedes of the small size inflict a deadly bite (+4
bonus to saving throw), but cause no damage if the saving throw is
successful.
Centipede, Giant (Small, Non-lethal)
Hit Dice: 1d2
Armor Class: 9 [10]
Attacks: Bite (1 hp damage)
Saving Throw: 18
Special: Non-lethal poison, +4 save
Move: 13
Alignment: Neutrality
Challenge Level/XP: 1/15
The non-lethal variety of giant centipede has a painful bits but its
poison is only crippling, not lethal. Failing a saving throw (at a +4
bonus) against the poison of this centipede causes 1d4 rounds of
crippling pain (the victim is helpless, as when asleep). Additionally, the
limb (roll 1d4) is temporarily crippled (treat as a disease) for 2d4 days.
A crippled leg reduces movement by 50%; a crippled shield arm cannot
wield weapon or shield; a crippled sword arm attacks at -4. A second
bite on a leg reduces movement to one quarter normal, and a third bite
to the legs reduces movement to 1 foot per minute (prone, dragging
oneself by the arms).
Centipede, Giant (Man-sized)
Hit Dice: 2
Armor Class: 5 [14]
Attacks: Bite (1d8)
Saving Throw: 16
Special: Lethal poison, +6 save
Move: 15
Alignment: Neutrality
Challenge Level/XP: 4/240
7ft long. The man-sized giant centipede is a deadly predator with armored
segments, a strong bite, and a lethal (though relatively weak) poison.
Centipede, Giant (Greater)
Hit Dice: 4
Armor Class: 0 [20]
Attacks: Bite (3d8)
Saving Throw: 13
Special: Lethal poison, +4 save
Move: 18
Alignment: Neutrality
Challenge Level/XP: 6/400
A 20' long horror of chitin, multiple legs, and clashing pincers
dripping with venom.
Chimera
Hit Dice: 9
Armor Class: Goat 6 [13], Lion 5 [14], Dragon 2 [17]
Attacks: 2 claws (1d3), 2 goat horns (1d4), 1 lion bite (2d4), and 1
dragon bite (3d4)
Saving Throw: 6
Special: Breathes fire
Move: 9/18 (flying)
Alignment: Chaos (sometimes Neutrality)
Challenge Level/XP: 11/1,700
The chimera has three heads: one is the head of a goat, one the head of
a lion, and one the head of a dragon. Great wings rise from its lion-like
body. The dragon head can breathe fire (3 times per day) with a range
of 50 ft, causing 3d8 damage to anyone caught within the fiery blast
(saving throw for half damage).
Cockatrice
Hit Dice: 5
Armor Class: 6 [13]
Attacks: Bite (1d3+ turn to stone)
Saving Throw: 12
Special: Bite turns to stone
Move: 6/18 (flying)
Alignment: Neutrality
Challenge Level/XP: 7/600
This nasty creature resembles a bat-winged rooster with a long,
serpentine tail. Its bite turns enemies to stone unless the victim makes a
successful saving throw.
Crocodile
Hit Dice: 3
Armor Class: 4 [15]
Attacks: Bite (1d6)
Saving Throw: 14
Special: None
Move: 9 (12 swimming)
Alignment: Neutrality
Challenge Level/XP: 3/60
Some normal crocodiles are man-eaters; all are dangerous and can
conceal themselves well.
Crocodile, Giant
Hit Dice: 6
Armor Class: 3 [16]
Attacks: Bite (3d6)
Saving Throw: 11
Special: None
Move: 9 (12 swimming)
Alignment: Neutrality
Challenge Level/XP: 6/400
The smallest of giant crocodiles are about 20ft long (normal crocodiles
can grow to be as long as 15ft).
Demon, Baalroch
Hit Dice: 9
Armor Class: 2 [17]
Attacks: Sword (1d12+2) and whip (see below)
Saving Throw: 6
Special: Magic resistance (75%), surrounded by fire
Move: 6/15 (flying)
Alignment: Chaos
Challenge Level/XP: 10/1,400
The Baalroch’s name means, roughly, the Bull of Baal: the Baal-
aurochs. (The aurochs was a bull that stood twelve feet tall at the
shoulder, and Baal is an ancient and evil pagan deity.) These powerful
demons somewhat resemble vast minotaurs with great, spreading bat-
wings; they burn with the fires of hell and are wreathed in flame. The
spells of casters below 6th level do not affect them, and against higher-
level spell casters they are still 75% immune to all spells.
In combat, a baalroch uses whip and sword. The whip can be used
to reach great distances; on a successful hit the victim is pulled close
to the baalroch and burned by the fires of the demon’s body (3d6 hit
points). Baalrochs are sometimes referred to in ancient texts as Balor or
Baalor, which may be the name of a single demon rather than a term for
all of them. A baalroch could be forced or tricked into the service of a
powerful wizard, but the risk would be immense.
Demon, Dretch
Hit Dice: 4
Armor Class: 2 [17]
Attacks: 2 claws (1d4), 1 bite (1d6)
Special: Magical abilities.
Move: 9
Saving Throw: 13
Alignment: Chaos
Challenge Level/XP: 6/400
These creatures are fat, with long, spindly arms and legs. They have
rudimentary human heads, with slobbering jaws and folds of fat. Dretch
demons have some weak demonic powers. Although they are not par-
ticularly intelligent, they can cause a horrible stinking cloud once per
day, can teleport once per day, can cause darkness (10-foot diameter)
once per day, and can summon 1d4 giant rats once per day.
Demon, Erinyes
Hit Dice: 6
Armor Class: 2[17]
Attacks: 1 bronze sword (1d6 + paralysis)
Special: Magic resistance (25%),magical abilities, immune to fire and
cold, entangle
Move: 12/24 (flying)
Save: 11
Alignment: Chaos
Challenge Level/XP: 9/1100
The erinyes, the “Furies” of Ancient Greek mythology, are female
demons who pursue those guilty of crimes against the order of the
gods. Their appearance is so terrible as to cause fear (saving throw).
They are able to see invisible things and locate objects at will, so it is
impossible to hide from them. Each fury carries a whip which, if it hits,
entangles the victim (saving throw) until the Fury releases it. The Furies
are immune to fire and cold, and have a magic resistance of 25%. The
blade of a Fury’s sword causes paralysis (saving throw).
Demon, Glabrezu
Hit Dice: 10
Armor Class: –3[22]
Attacks: 2 pincers (2d6), 2 claws (1d3), 1 bite (1d4+1)
Special: Magic resistance (60%), immune to fire, magical abilities
Move: 9
Saving Throw: 5
Alignment: Chaos
Challenge Level/XP: 11/1700
(Third-Category Demon)
The third-category demons, Glabrezu, are massive and horrible,
standing ten feet high or more. They have goat horns and a humanoid
shape, but no wings. Four arms sprout from the torso: two huge arms
with great crab-pincers, and two much shorter arms with claws.
Glabrezu can cause darkness in a 10-foot radius, are immune to fire,
can cause fear at will, can levitate at will, can polymorph themselves,
and are 60% resistant to magic.
Demon, Hezrou
Hit Dice: 9
Armor Class: 0[19]
Attacks: 2 claws (1d3), 1 bite (2d8)
Special: Magic resistance 50%, magical abilities
Move: 9/14 (flying)
Saving Throw: 6
Alignment: Chaos
Challenge Level/XP: 11/1700
(Second-Category Demon)
Toad-like demons with bat wings, the Hezrou have magic resistance of
50%. At will, they can cause fear (per the spell), detect invisibility (per the
spell), and cause darkness n a 15-foot radius. They are immune to fire.
Demon, Lemures
Hit Dice: 3
Armor Class: 7 [12]
Attacks: Claw (1d3)
Saving Throw: 14
Special: Regenerate (1 hp/round)
Move: 3
Alignment: Chaos
Challenge Level/XP: 4/120
Lemures are vaguely humanoid, but their flesh is mud-like, shifting
and soft upon their horrible bodies. (This amorphous form allows them
to regenerate 1 hp per round.) Lemures are lower forms of demons,
the fleshly manifestations of damned souls. These demons can be
permanently destroyed only by sprinkling their disgusting bodies with
holy water.
Demon, Manes
Hit Dice: 1
Armor Class: 5[14]
Attacks: 2 claws (1d2), 1 bite (1d4)
Special: Half damage from non-magic weapons
Move: 5
Saving Throw: 18
Alignment: Chaos
Challenge Level/XP: 2/30
Pathetic, damned souls, manes are demons no larger than humans,
with gray skin and empty eyes. Non-magical weapons inflict only half
normal damage on them.
Demon, Marilith
Hit Dice: 8
Armor Class: –3[22]
Attacks: 6 weapons (1d8), tail (1d8)
Special: Magic resistance (80%), +1 or better magic weapon required to
hit, immune to fire, magical abilities
Move: 12
Saving Throw: 8
Alignment: Chaos
Challenge Level/XP: 13/2300
(Fifth-Category Demon)
Mariliths appear as a cruel-eyed beautiful woman with a six-armed
torso, but the lower body of a huge constrictor snake. They can wield
weapons in all six arms at once, and the tail, if it hits, constricts for
automatic damage after the initial hit. Mariliths are among the most
feared of demons – as much, even, as the mighty Baalrochs. They can,
at will, cast Charm Person, Levitate, and Polymorph Self, and are 80%
resistant to magic. Fire does not affect them.
Demon, Nalfeshnee
Hit Dice: 11
Armor Class: –1[20]
Attacks: 2 claws (1d4), 1 bite (1d6+2)
Special: Magic resistance (65%), +1 or better magic weapon needed to
hit, immune to fire, +2 on to-hit rolls, magical abilities
Move: 9/14 (flying)
Saving Throw: 4
Alignment: Chaos
Challenge Level/XP: 13/2300
(Fourth-Category Demon)
Nalfeshnee demons have the body of an enormous gorilla, the head
of a boar, and cloven hooves. These massive, brutish demons are
actually quite intelligent, despite their appearance, an incongruity
that has deceived and doomed many who would attempt to control or
enslave them. The very size of a nalfeshnee prevents them from being
particularly agile flyers, though they do have wings. Nalfeshnee are
incredibly powerful (+2 to hit), and have various demonic powers in
addition to being immune to fire: at will, they can cause fear (as per the
spell), polymorph self, and dispel magic (at will). They can also create
a symbol of discord once per day.
Demon, Quasit
Hit Dice: 3
Armor Class: 2[17]
Attack: 2 claws (1d2 + non-lethal poison), 1 bite (1d3)
Special: Magic resistance (25%), regenerate (1 hp/round), non-lethal
poison, magical abilities
Move: 14
Saving Throw: 14
Alignment: Chaos
Challenge Level/XP: 7/600
Quasits are demon familiars, much like imps but without wings and
with a less human-like shape. A quasit can polymorph into two other
forms (commonly a giant centipede and a bat). These demons are 25%
resistant to magic, regenerate at 1 hp per round, can become invisible
at will, and once per day can cast a Fear spell. The quasit’s claws are
laden with a poison that reduces an opponent’s Dexterity score by 1
point (saving throw applies, lasts for 2d6 rounds).
Demon, Succubus
Hit Dice: 6
Armor Class: 9 [10]
Attacks: 2 scratches (1d3)
Saving Throw: 11
Special: Magic resistance (70%), immune to non-magic weapons, cause
darkness in a 10-foot diameter, level drain (1 level) with kiss, summon
other demons, spells,change shape.
Move: 12 (18 fly)
Alignment: Chaotic
Challenge Level/XP: 9/1,100
A succubus is a creature of demonic lust, a drinker of souls who offers
fatal temptation to mortals that fall into the trap of her deadly embraces:
each kiss drains one level of experience. (The male form of this demon
is called an incubus. A succubus is always female, just as an incubus
is always male.) The demon’s form is that of a supernaturally beautiful
woman, curvaceous and alluring, but whose furled bat wings and deli-
cate horns betray her true nature. Small white fangs gleam from behind
the demoness’s full lips, and when she is enraged the pupils of her eyes
will contract and shift into those of a vicious serpent.

A succubus can “cast” Charm Person whenever desired, as well as ESP,
Clairaudience, and Suggestion. They can change shape at will, but only into
human or human-like forms. Succubi also have the ability to call forth (by
gate) other demons. A succubus can summon a demon
prince(40%chancetosucceed),but will seldom do so, for the price to be paid
afterwards is generally significant and unpleasant.  However, a succubus can
summon a Baalroch demon or a Nalfeshnee (fourth- category demon), again, with
a 40% chance of success regardless of the type of demon being summoned.  If
a succubus does not specify the sort of demon she is summoning, there is a 5%
chance that the respondent will be a demon prince, and if not, there is a 75%
chance that the demon will be of the fourth cate- gory, a Nalfeshnee.
Succubi almost never rely upon physical attacks; theyusetheircharm and suggestion abilities to allow them to bestow their deadly kisses upon opponents.
Demon, Vrock
Hit Dice: 8
Armor Class: 1 [18]
Attacks: 1 beak (1d6), 2 foreclaws (1d4), 2 rear claws (1d6)
Special: Magic resistance (50%), immune to fire, darkness
Move: 12/18 (flying)
Saving Throw: 8
Alignment: Chaos
Challenge Level/XP: 9/1100
(First-Category Demon)
These demons are vulture-headed, with feathered humanoid bodies,
and huge dark-feathered wings. All can create darkness in a radius of
5 feet and are immune to fire. They use their wings to bring both their
arms and legs into combat, along with their beaked bite. Vrock demons
are quite stupid, though like most demons they consider themselves to
be tremendously intelligent.
Demon Prince, Orcus
Hit Dice: 30 (125hp)
Armor Class: –6 [25]
Attacks: 1 staff (death – no save), tail (2d8), 1 claw (2d8)
Special: Magic resistance (75%), +3 magic weapon required to hit,
immune to fire and charm, death staff, spells, magical abilities, control
undead, summon demon minions
Move: 9 (Fly 20)
Saving Throw: 3
Alignment: Chaos
Challenge Level/XP: 35/6800
Orcus is a demon-prince of death and the dead (specifically, the undead),
and can also call upon his lesser demon-minions as well. His staff causes
death at its touch, and he uses magic-user spells at the following levels.
Level 1: 6; level 2: 5; level 3: 4; level 4: 3; level 5: 2; level 6: 1. He has
a magic resistance of 75%, and is completely immune to fire and charm
spells. At will Orcus can animate dead, create darkness (15 foot radius),
cause fear, dispel magic, make a suggestion per the spell, polymorph
himself, or use ESP. Such powers can be used at the same time as normal
attacks. His skull-tipped staff might have independent powers of its own,
even possibly being an entity in its own right, merely cooperating with
the demon prince and using him for its own purposes.
Djinni
Hit Dice: 7+3
Armor Class: 4 [15]
Attacks: Fist or weapon (1d10+1)
Saving Throw: 9
Special: magical powers, whirlwind
Move: 9/24 (flying)
Alignment: Any
Challenge Level/XP: 9/1,100
Djinn are one of the genies of folklore, creatures of the air (and
possibly of the elemental planes). They can carry 700 lbs of weight, and
have a number of magical powers. A djinni can create food and water as
well as wooden and cloth objects. They can also create objects of metal
(including coins), but all such magically created metals disappear in
time. Djinn can call up illusions, and although these are quite excellent
they disappear when touched. A djinni can give itself a gaseous form
(cannot attack or be attacked, can enter any area that is not airtight),
and can become invisible at will. Finally, a djinni can turn itself into a
whirlwind, sweeping away any creature with one or fewer hit dice. (The
diameter of the whirlwind is 10 feet.) More powerful types of djinn
might be capable of granting limited wishes or even true wishes.
Doppelganger
Hit Dice: 4
Armor Class: 5 [14]
Attacks: Claw (1d12)
Saving Throw: 13 (5 against any magic)
Special: Mimics shape, immune to sleep and charm spells
Move: 9
Alignment: Chaos
Challenge Level/XP: 5/240
A doppelganger can change its form to resemble the physical
appearance (including clothing and gear) of any person. These creatures
are immune to sleep and charm, and are considered magic resistant for
purposes such as breaking through Wizard Lock and similar spells. They
have a very good saving throw (5) against magic of all kinds.
Dragon, Black

for a hundred years and a day within the dryad’s tree.
Dwarf
Hit Dice: 1
Armor Class: 4 [15]
Attacks: War hammer (1d4+1)
Saving Throw: 17
Special: Detects attributes of stonework
Move: 6
Alignment: Law
Challenge Level/XP: 1/15
Statistics above are for the common Dwarf with no particular unusual
characteristics. A dwarf-at-arms would usually have a full 8 hit points,
reflecting skill and general toughness. Stronger Dwarfs (sergeants-at-
arms, for example) might have more hit dice or unusual bonuses to hit,
or even magical abilities if such is possible (Norse myths are a good
example of this.) Do not bother to treat more-powerful NPC dwarfs as
Fighters or other character types; just assign the right number of hit dice
and abilities (if any) and keep moving along with the fantasy.
Efreeti
Hit Dice: 10
Armor Class: 2 [17]
Attacks: Fist or sword (1d8+5)
Saving Throw: 5
Special: Wall of fire
Move: 9/24 (flying)
Alignment: Chaos
Challenge Level/XP: 12/2,000
Efreet are a type of genie, associated with fire (in contrast to the djinn,
who have powers over the air). Efreet can carry up to 1000 pounds of
weight, and under the right circumstances they can be forced to serve
as a slave until they figure out how to free themselves. An efreeti can
create a wall of fire (per the spell). They appear as giant humans with
cruel features, their skin flickering with flames.
Elementals
Elementals are living manifestations of the basic forms of matter: air,
earth, fire, and water. They are usually summoned from their native
planes of existence to do the bidding of a powerful wizard. These
beings can also be “chained” within objects or structures to give the
objects magical properties. Elementals are barely intelligent at all, but
they are as powerful as the forces of nature that they actually are.
Elemental, Air
Hit Dice: 8, 12, or 16
Armor Class: 2 [17]
Attacks: Strike (2d8)
Saving Throw: 8, 3, or 3
Special: Whirlwind
Move: 36 (flying)
Alignment: Neutrality
Challenge Level/XP: 8 HD (9/1,100), 12 HD (13/2,300), 16 HD (17/3,400)
Air elementals can turn into a whirlwind of air with a diameter of 30
ft, hurling any creature of 1 HD or less for great distances (and almost
certainly killing them). These elemental whirlwinds are approximately
100 ft in height.
Elemental, Earth
Hit Dice: 8, 12, or 16
Armor Class: 2 [17]
Attacks: Fist (3d6)
Saving Throw: 8, 3, or 3

Alignment: Neutrality
Challenge Level/XP: 8 HD (9/1,100), 12 HD (13/2,300), 16 HD (17/3,400)
Earth elementals are hulking man-shapes of rock and earth. They
batter opponents with their great fists, although damage is reduced by
1d6 if the opponent is not standing upon earth or rock. Earth elementals
can tear apart stone structures, able to rip down even a castle wall in a
matter of 1d4+4 rounds (minutes).
Elemental, Fire
Hit Dice: 8, 12, or 16
Armor Class: 2 [17]
Attacks: Strike (2d6)
Saving Throw: 8, 3, or 3
Special: Ignite materials
Move: 12
Alignment: Neutrality
Challenge Level/XP: 8 HD (9/1,100), 12 HD (13/2,300), 16 HD (17/3,400)
Fire elementals are formless masses of flame, perhaps with a vaguely
human shape. Their attacks cause flammable materials (including
wood) to ignite if the material fails a saving throw (as determined by
the Referee).
Elemental, Water
Hit Dice: 8, 12, or 16
Armor Class: 2 [17]
Attacks: Strike (3d6)
Saving Throw: 8, 3, or 3
Special: Can overturn boats
Move: 6/18 (swimming)
Alignment: Neutrality
Challenge Level/XP: 8 HD (9/1,100), 12 HD (13/2,300), 16 HD (17/3,400)
Water elementals cannot move more than 60 ft from a large body of
water, and their damage is reduced by 1d6 if the opponent is not standing
in water (or swimming, etc.). These powerful beings can overturn small
boats, and can overturn a ship if given 1d4+4 rounds to work at it. On
water, they can attack ships, battering them to pieces within 1 hour if
not prevented or distracted.
Elf
Hit Dice: 1+1
Armor Class: 5 [14]
Attacks: Sword (1d8) or 2 arrows (1d6)
Saving Throw: 17
Special: None
Move: 12
Alignment: Law (sometimes Neutrality)
Challenge Level/XP: 1/15
The example above is for a typical Elf; trained warriors would likely
have the maximum 9 hit points. Obviously, Elves encountered in the
course of a party’s adventuring will have a variety of powers and
different attributes. The Referee will assign such powers as he sees
fit, in accordance with the way he envisions elves. They might be the
woodland dwellers of Tolkien’s The Hobbit, or the high Elves of the
Lord of the Rings, or might be the faerie folk of Irish legend. In any case,
the Referee should not bother trying to fit an idea of “advanced” Elves
into the constraints of character classes—just assign their attributes to
fit the concept. Non-player characters are not subject to the rules that
govern building a player character; they are tools for good fantasy.
Fish, Giant
Hit Dice: varies (see below)
Armor Class: 7 [12]
Attacks: 1 bite (1d6 per 5 feet in length)
Saving Throw: varies (see below)
Special: None (or swallow whole: see below)
Move: varies (roll 1d4+1 x10)
Alignment: Neutrality (usually)
Challenge Level/XP: varies
Giant fish can range from something barely larger than a shark to
something as large as a whale. In general, these creatures will be at least 11
feet long, and will have 1HD per 2 feet of length. Thus, if rolling randomly
for a giant fish, roll 1d10+10 feet to determine the length, and the hit dice
will be half that number. If the roll is a “10,” (i.e., the fish would be 20 feet
long) then it is a REALLY giant fish: roll 1d20 for additional feet in length.
Thus, the maximum size for a giant fish is 40 feet, and for some unknown
reason giant fish never seem to be exactly 20 feet in length; a matter for
philosophers to puzzle upon. The truly giant fish can most likely swallow
people whole on a natural roll of 18-20. Use the rules for creating monsters
to determine the saving throws and experience point values of the varying
sizes of giant fish. Giant fish might be intelligent (5% chance), in which
case they might have an alignment other than Neutrality.
Gargoyle
Hit Dice: 4+4
Armor Class: 5 [14]
Attacks: 2 claws (1d3), 1 bite (1d4), 1 horn (1d6)
Saving Throw: 13
Special: None
Move: 9/15 (flying)
Alignment: Chaos
Challenge Level/XP: 6/400
Gargoyles are winged beings resembling the carven monstrosities that
bedeck the walls of cathedrals and many subterranean dungeons. They
are terribly vicious predators.
Gelatinous Cube
Hit Dice: 4
Armor Class: 8 [11]
Attacks: Attack (2d4)
Saving Throw: 13
Special: Paralysis, immune to lightning and cold
Move: 6
Alignment: Neutrality
Challenge Level/XP: 5/240
Gelatinous cubes are semi-transparent cubes that slosh through
subterranean passages, engulfing debris and carrion to digest. Their
entire substance is acidic; if the cube hits successfully, the victim must
make a saving throw or become paralyzed (6 turns) for the cube to
devour. Most gelatinous cubes contain various metallic treasures or
gems that they have engulfed but not yet digested.
Ghoul
Hit Dice: 2
Armor Class: 6 [13]
Attacks: 2 claws (1d3), 1 bite (1d4)
Saving Throw: 16
Special: Immunities, paralysis
Move: 9
Alignment: Chaos
Challenge Level/XP: 3/60
Ghouls are pack-hunting undead corpse eaters. They are immune, like
most undead, to charms and sleep spells. The most dangerous feature of
these horrid, cunning creatures is their paralyzing touch: any hit from a ghoul
requires a saving throw or the victim becomes paralyzed for 3d6 turns.
Giants
Giants are a staple of fantasy gaming, huge and dangerous creatures
that often have a taste for human flesh. Most are not particularly
intelligent.
Giant, Cloud
Hit Dice: 12+1d6 points
Armor Class: 2 [17]
Attacks: Weapon (6d6)
Saving Throw: 3
Special: Hurl boulders
Move: 15
Alignment: Chaos (sometimes Neutrality)
Challenge Level/XP: 13/2,300
Cloud giants are cunning beasts, often living in cloud-castles in the
sky (hence their name). They throw rocks for 6d6 hit points of damage.
Cloud giants are famous for their ability to smell out food, enemies,
and Englishmen.
Giant, Fire
Hit Dice: 11 +1d6 points
Armor Class: 3 [16]
Attacks: Weapon (5d6)
Saving Throw: 4
Special: Hurl boulders, immune to fire
Move: 12
Alignment: Chaos (sometimes Neutrality)
Challenge Level/XP: 12/2,000

of basalt or even iron. They throw boulders for 5d6 hit points.
Giant, Frost
Hit Dice: 10+1d6 hit points
Armor Class: 4 [15]
Attacks: Weapon (4d6)
Saving Throw: 5
Special: Hurl boulders, immune to cold
Move: 12
Alignment: Chaos (sometimes Neutrality)
Challenge Level/XP: 11/1,700
Frost giants dwell in cold regions, where they build (or conquer)
castles in remote places of ice and snow. They throw boulders or great
chunks of ice for 4d6 points of damage.
Giant, Hill
Hit Dice: 8+2
Armor Class: 4 [15]
Attacks: Weapon (2d8)
Saving Throw: 8
Special: Hurl boulders
Move: 12
Alignment: Chaos
Challenge Level/XP: 9/1,100
Hill giants are the least of the giant races; most are brutish cave-
dwellers who dress in pelts and uncured hides. They throw rocks for
2d8 points of damage.
Giant, Stone
Hit Dice: 9+3 hit points
Armor Class: 0 [20]
Attacks: Club (3d6)
Saving Throw: 6
Special: Hurl boulders
Move: 12
Alignment: Chaos (sometimes Neutrality)
Challenge Level/XP: 10/1,400
Stone giants dwell in caves, isolated in the mountain fastnesses. They
throw rocks for 3d6 points of damage, and can be quite crafty in setting
up ambushes in their native mountains. Travelers who wander into the
territory of stone giants seldom return.
Giant, Storm
Hit Dice: 15+5
Armor Class: 1 [18]
Attacks: Weapon (7d6)
Saving Throw: 3
Special: Throw boulders, control weather
Move: 15
Alignment: Neutral (sometimes Law or Chaos)
Challenge Level/XP: 16/ 3,200
Storm giants are the largest of giants, the most intelligent, the most
magical, and the most likely to talk with humans rather than simply
devour them. Storm giants can live in underwater sea-castles as well
as on the heights of mountains. They throw boulders for 7d6 points of
damage, and have the power to control weather (as per the spell).
Gnoll
Hit Dice: 2
Armor Class: 5 [14]
Attacks: Bite (2d4) or weapon (1d10)
Saving Throw: 16
Special: None
Move: 9
Alignment: Chaos
Challenge Level/XP: 2/30
Gnolls are tall humanoids with hyena-like heads. They may be found
both above ground and in subterranean caverns. They form into loosely
organized clans, often ranging far from home in order to steal and kill
with rapacious ferocity.
Goblin
Hit Dice: 1d6 hit points
Armor Class: 7 [12]
Attacks: Weapon (1d6)
Saving Throw: 18
Special: -1 to hit in sunlight
Move: 9
Alignment: Chaos
Challenge Level/XP: B/10
Goblins are small creatures (4 ft tall or so) that inhabit dark woods,
underground caverns, and (possibly) the otherworldly realms of the fey.
They attack at -1 in the full sunlight.
Golem, Clay
Hit Dice: 12 (45 hp)
Armor Class: 7 [12]
Attacks: 1 fist (3d10)
Saving Throw: 5
Special: Immune to slashing and piercing weapons, immune to most
spells.
Move: 8
Alignment: Neutrality
Challenge Level/XP: 14/2,600
The “original” golem of folklore, clay golems may be created by Cler-
ics or powerful priests. They are massive clay statues of human beings,
imbued with a rudimentary intelligence and the ability to move and fol-
low their masters’ commands. For each round of combat, a clay golem
has a 1% chance (cumulative) to go berserk, leaving its master’s control
and attacking enemies and allies alike. Clay golems are not damaged by
slashing or piercing weapons. They are immune to all spells other than
those affecting earth, and these have very diminished effects – with one
exception. An earthquake spell may be used to utterly destroy a clay
golem.
Golem, Flesh
Hit Dice: 45 hit points
Armor Class: 9 [10]
Attacks: 2 fists (2d8)
Saving Throw: 4
Special: Hit only by magic weapons, slowed by fire and cold, immune
to most spells, healed by lightning
Move: 8
Alignment: Neutrality
Challenge Level/XP: 12/2,000
A creation stitched together from human limbs and other parts, a
flesh golem is similar to Frankenstein’s monster. Only +1 or better
magic weapons can harm a flesh golem, and it is slowed by fire and
cold spells. Lightning heals the golem for the number of points of
damage that it would normally inflict. No other type of spell affects
a flesh golem.
Golem, Iron
Hit Dice: 80 hit points
Armor Class: 3 [16]
Attacks: Weapon or fist (4d10)
Saving Throw: 3
Special: Poison gas, immune to all weapons +2 or less, slowed by
lightning, healed by fire, immune to most spells
Move: 6
Alignment: Neutrality
Challenge Level/XP: 17/3,500
Iron golems are huge moving statues of iron. They can breathe a 10-
foot-radius cloud of poison gas as well as attacking with great power.
Weapons of +2 or less do not affect iron golems. These hulking statues
are slowed by lightning spells, but fire-based spells actually restore hit
points to them. No other type of spell affects them.
Golem, Stone
Hit Dice: 60 hit points
Armor Class: 5 [14]
Attacks: Fist (3d8)
Saving Throw: 3
Special: Unaffected by +1 or lesser weapons, immune to most spells
Move: 6
Alignment: Neutrality
Challenge Level/XP: 16/3,200
Stone golems are massive stone statues animated by very powerful
magics (much more than just animate object, in other words). They are
slowed by fire spells, damaged by rock-to-mud spells, and healed by
the reverse. Spells that affect rock, and fire spells, are the only ones that
affect stone golems. They can only be hit by +2 or better weapons.
Gorgon
Hit Dice: 8
Armor Class: 2 [17]
Attacks: Gore (2d6)
Saving Throw: 8
Special: Breath turns creatures to stone
Move: 12
Alignment: Chaos
Challenge Level/XP: 10/1,400
Gorgons are bull-like creatures with scales like dragons. Their breath
turns creatures to stone (60-foot range, saving throw applies).

Ooze, Grey
Hit Dice: 3+3
Armor Class: 7 [12]
Attacks: Strike (2d6)
Saving Throw: 14
Special: Acid, immunities
Move: 1
Alignment: Neutrality
Challenge Level/XP: 5/ 240
Grey ooze is almost identical in appearance to wet rock, but it is a
slimy, formless substance that devours prey and carrion with its acidic
secretions, lashing out to strike enemies. Grey ooze is immune to spells,
heat, and cold damage. Metal (but not stone or wood) must make a
saving throw vs. acid when exposed to grey ooze (even if the contact
is as brief as the strike of a sword) or be rotted through. When the
grey ooze hits a character in metal armor, the armor must make an item
saving throw. Only cutting and piercing damages a grey ooze—it is
impervious to blunt or crushing attacks.

Green Slime
Hit Dice: 0
Green slime isn’t technically a monster, just an extremely dangerous
hazard in underground tombs and other such places. Any metal or
organic substance it touches begins to turn to green slime (saving
throw). It can be killed with fire or extreme cold, and the transformation
process can be arrested by the use of a Cure Disease spell.

Griffon
Hit Dice: 7
Armor Class: 3 [16]
Attacks: 2 claws (1d4), 1 bite (2d8)
Saving Throw: 9
Special: None
Move: 12/27 (flying)
Alignment: Neutrality
Challenge Level/XP: 8/800
Griffons have the body of a lion, with the head, fore-claws, and wings
of an eagle. These creatures can be tamed and ridden as mounts. They
usually nest in high mountain aeries, where they lay their eggs and hunt
their prey. Because the fledglings can be tamed, young griffons and
griffon eggs command a very high price in the marketplaces of the great
cities, or to noble lords and wizards.
Harpy
Hit Dice: 3
Armor Class: 7 [12]
Attacks: 2 talons (1d3) and weapon (1d6)
Saving Throw: 14
Special: Siren-song
Move: 6/18 (flying)
Alignment: Chaos
Challenge Level/XP: 4/120
Harpies have the upper body of a human female and the lower
body and wings of a vulture. Their song is a charm that draws its
victims to the harpy (saving throw applies), and the harpy’s touch
casts the equivalent of a charm person spell (again, saving throw
applies).
Hell Hound
Hit Dice: 4–7
Armor Class: 4 [15]
Attacks: Bite (1d6)
Saving Throw: 13, 12, 11, or 9
Special: Breathe fire
Move: 12
Alignment: Chaos
Challenge Level/XP: 4 HD (5/240), 5 HD (6/400), 6 HD (7/600), 7 HD (8/800)
Hell hounds are fire-breathing dogs of the underworlds or lower
planes. In addition to biting, they can breathe fire each round, inflicting
2 hp damage per hit die (10 ft range, saving throw for half damage).
Hippogriff
Hit Dice: 3+3
Armor Class: 5 [14]
Attacks: 2 claws (1d6), 1 bite (1d10)
Saving Throw: 14
Special: None
Move: 18/24 (flying)
Alignment: Neutrality
Challenge Level/XP: 4/120
The hippogriff is similar to a griffon, having the head, foreclaws, and
wings of an eagle, but instead of the body of a lion, it has the body of a
horse. The poem Orlando Furioso (written by the poet Dante in 1516)
suggests that the hippogriff is the offspring of a griffon and a horse—
but they are apparently an independent breed, for folkloric tradition
holds that griffons frequently attack hippogriffs. Hippogriffs are not
as hard to train as griffons—again, from Orlando Furioso: “Drawn by
enchantment from his distant lair, The wizard thought but how to tame
the foal; And, in a month, instructed him to bear Saddle and bit, and
gallop to the goal; And execute on earth or in mid air, All shifts of
manege, course and caracole…”
Hobgoblin
Hit Dice: 1+1
Armor Class: 5 [14]
Attacks: Weapon (1d8)
Saving Throw: 17
Special: None
Move: 9
Alignment: Chaos
Challenge Level/XP: 1/15
Hobgoblins are simply large goblins, possibly a separate breed living
apart from their smaller cousins, or perhaps not, as the Referee decides.
As a matter of the campaign’s flavoring, the Referee might choose
to make hobgoblins the “fey” goblins of Irish legend, while regular
goblins are the more Tolkien-style underground-dwellers.
Horse
Horses are AC 7 [12], with riding horses having 2 HD and warhorses
having 3 HD. Horses have a movement speed of 18.
Humans
Humans are such a versatile race that any number of “monsters” and
NPCs can be made from them. Berserker warriors, tribesmen, cavemen,
princesses, evil high priests, captains of the guard, foot-soldiers, and
tavern-keepers are all different human “monsters.” Don’t try to build
your non-player characters according to the rules for player characters.
Just make up their stats and abilities as you see fit.
Human, Bandit
Hit Dice: 1
Armor Class: 7 [12]
Attacks: Weapon (1d8)
Saving Throw: 17
Special: None

Armor Class: 7 [12]
Attacks: Weapon (1d8)
Saving Throw: 17
Special: Berserking
Move: 12

soldiers. These are the leaders of city guard units and other small
military groups.
Human, Soldier
Hit Dice: 1
Armor Class: 7 [12]
Attacks: Weapon (1d8)
Saving Throw: 17
Special: None
Move: 12

Challenge Level/XP: 3/60
Human soldiers serve as city guardsmen, mercenaries, and men-at-
arms. They are generally armed with leather armor and a mace, sword,
or spear.
Hydra
Hit Dice: 5-12 (equal to the number of heads)
Armor Class: 5 [14]
Attacks: 5-12 bites (1d6)
Saving Throw: 12, 11, 9, 8, 6, 5, 4, or 3
Special: None
Move: 9
Alignment: Neutrality
Challenge Level/XP: 5 HD (7/600), 6 HD (8/800), 7 HD (9/1,100), 8 HD (10/1,400), 9 HD (11/1,700), 10 HD (12/2,000), 11 HD (13/2,300), 12 HD (14/2,600)
Hydrae are great lizard-like or snake-like creatures with multiple
heads. Each head has one hit die of its own, and when an individual
head takes that much damage, that head dies. The body has as many
hit dice as the total of the heads, so it is a matter of good strategy for
adventurers to focus either on killing heads (when all the heads are dead
the body dies) or killing the creature by attacking the body (in which
case the heads die, too). Hydrae that breathe fire or regenerate their
heads are also known to exist.
Invisible Stalker
Hit Dice: 8
Armor Class: 3 [16]
Attacks: “Bite” (4d4)
Saving Throw: 8
Special: Invisible, flies
Move: 12
Alignment: Neutrality
Challenge Level/XP: 9/1,100
Invisible stalkers are generally found only as a result of the spell
Invisible Stalker. They are invisible flying beings created to follow a
single command made by the caster.
Kobold
Hit Dice: 1d4 hp
Armor Class: 6 [13]
Attacks: Weapon (1d6)
Saving Throw: 18
Special: None
Move: 6
Alignment: Chaos
Challenge Level/XP: A/5
Kobolds are subterranean, vaguely goblin-like humanoids. They have
a -1 penalty when fighting above ground. Many use slings or short bows,
and they fight with short swords or spiked clubs in melee combat.
Leech, Giant
Hit Dice: 2
Armor Class: 8 [11]
Attacks: 1 bite (d4CON)
Saving Throw: 16
Special: Suck blood
Move: 6
Alignment: Neutrality
Challenge Level/XP: 5/240
If a giant leech hits with its attack, it drains a level of experience on
the following round. Anyone reduced below a level of 0 will die. Lost
levels of experience most likely return at a rate of 1 per day, if the
character rests. Freshwater leeches might simply drain hit points.
Lich
Hit Dice: 12+
Armor Class: 0 [20]
Attacks: Hand (1d10 + automatic paralysis)
Saving Throw: 3
Special: Appearance causes paralytic fear, touch causes automatic
paralysis, spells

Liches are the undead remnants of wizards, either made undead by
their own deliberate acts during life, or as the result of other magical
forces (possibly including their own magics gone awry). A liche has the
same number of hit dice as the original Magic-User and the same spell-
casting powers. A liche’s touch causes paralysis with no saving throw,
and the very sight of one of these dread creatures causes any being of
4 HD or below to be paralyzed with fear. Liches are highly intelligent
and totally malign.
Lion
Hit Dice: 5+2
Armor Class: 6 [13]
Attacks: 2 claws (1d4), 1 bite (1d8)
Saving Throw: 12
Special: None
Move: 12
Alignment: Neutrality
Challenge Level/XP: 5/240
Male lions are noticeably
larger than their female
counterparts, and
easily identified
by their manes.
They are usually
solitary beasts,
found leading
a pride only
in their prime.
The lioness,
while smaller
and having an
AC of 7 [12], is
an indisputably
skillful hunter—
far faster and
more agile than
the male lion.
Lionesses often
coordinate with
others in their
pride to bring down prey.
Lizardman
Hit Dice: 2+1
Armor Class: 5 [14]
Attacks: 2 claws (1d3), 1 bite (1d8)
Saving Throw: 16
Special: Underwater
Move: 6/12 (swimming)
Alignment: Usually Chaos
Challenge Level/XP: 2/30
Lizardmen are reptilian humanoids, both male and female, usually
living in tribal villages in the depths of fetid swamps. Some can hold
their breath for long durations (an hour or more), while other can
actually breathe underwater.
Lurker, Ceiling
Hit Dice: 10
Armor Class: 6 [13]
Attacks: 1 crush (1d6)
Saving Throw: 5
Special: Smother
Move: 1/7 (flying)
Alignment: Neutrality
Challenge Level/XP: 10/1400
Lurkers resemble floating manta rays, with a rough, stone-like under-
surface. They levitate to ceiling-tops and wait for prey to walk under-
neath, whereupon they drop and enfold the victim in their thick “wings”
(to-hit roll). Anyone trapped inside a lurker’s clutches takes 1d6 points
of damage per round from crushing, and will suffocate within 1d4+1
rounds unless the lurker is killed. There is normally only a 10% chance
to detect a lurker’s presence visually before it attacks, and it has a 65%
chance to gain initiative automatically (unless a “surprise roll” system
is being used, in which case the lurker has a 4 in 6 chance to gain sur-
prise).
Lycanthropes
Lycanthropes are were-creatures, particularly those in whom the
disease permits assumption of a hybrid form of the human and animal.
They cannot be hit by normal weapons: only silver and magical weapons
affect them. If anyone is attacked and brought below 50% hit points by
a lycanthrope, the person will become a lycanthrope himself.

Hit Dice: 6
Armor Class: 3 [16]
Attacks: 2 claws (1d4), 1 bite (1d10)
Saving Throw: 11
Special: Lycanthropy, hit only by magic or silver weapons
Move: 12

Attacks: Bite (2d4)
Saving Throw: 13
Special: Lycanthropy, hit only by magic or silver weapons

Armor Class: 4 [15]
Attacks: 2 claws (1d3), 1 bite (1d8), 6 tail spikes (1d6)
Saving Throw: 11
Special: Tail spikes
Move: 12/18 (flying)
Alignment: Chaos

of a lion, and a tail tipped with 24 iron spikes. The manticore can hurl
up to 6 of the iron spikes from its tail per round, at a maximum range
of 180 ft.
Medusa
Hit Dice: 6
Armor Class: 5 [14]
Attacks: Weapon (1d4)
Saving Throw: 11
Special: Gaze turns to stone
Move: 9
Alignment: Chaos
Challenge Level/XP: 8/800
The terrifying medusa has a female face but hair of writhing snakes;
it has no legs, but the body of a serpent. The gaze of a medusa turns
anyone looking upon it into stone. In addition to the medusa’s relatively
weak melee-weapon attack, the snake-hair makes one attack per round,
causing no damage but inflicting a lethal poison with a successful hit
(saving throw applies).
Merman
Hit Dice: 1+3
Armor Class: 7 [12]
Attacks: Weapon (1d6)
Saving Throw: 17
Special: Breathe water
Move: 1/18 (swimming)

Attacks: Head butt (2d4), bite (1d3) and weapon (1d8)
Saving Throw: 11
Special: Never get lost in labyrinths
Move: 12
Alignment: Chaos
Challenge Level/XP: 6/400
The minotaur is a man-eating predator, with the head of a bull and
the body of a massive human, covered in shaggy hair. Most are not
particularly intelligent.
Mummy
Hit Dice: 6+4
Armor Class: 3 [16]
Attacks: Fist (1d12)
Saving Throw: 11
Special: Rot, hit only by magic weapons
Move: 6
Alignment: Chaos
Challenge Level/XP: 7/600
Mummies cannot be hit by normal weapons, and even magical
weapons cause only half damage. In addition to normal damage, their
touch also inflicts a rotting disease which prevents magical healing and
causes wounds to heal at one-tenth of the normal rate. A Cure Disease
spell can increase healing rate to one-half normal, but a Remove Curse
spell is required to completely lift the mummy’s curse.
Naga, Guardian
Hit Dice: 11
Armor Class: 3 [16]
Attacks: Bite (1d6 + poison)
Saving Throw: 4
Special: Spit poison, constriction, spells.
Move: 18
Alignment: Law
Challenge Level/XP: 13/2300
The largest and noblest of the naga, guardian nagas are from 20 to 25 feet
in length. They do not necessarily have a humanlike head, but some char-
acteristic (a flowing mane of hair, for instance) will immediately set their
appearance apart from normal serpents. They can bite or spit with lethal
poison, and if they hit with their coils they automatically cause 1d8 points
of constriction damage per round thereafter. Guardian nagas cast clerical
spells (2/2/1/1). A sample selection of spells for a guardian naga might in-
clude: level 1: Cure Light Wounds x2; level 2: Hold Person, Silence 15-foot
Radius; level 3: Cure Disease; level 4: Cure Serious Wounds.
Naga, Spirit
Hit Dice: 9
Armor Class: 4 [15]
Attacks: Bite (1d3 + poison)
Saving Throw: 6
Special: Poison, charm gaze, spells.
Move: 12
Alignment: Chaos
Challenge Level/XP: 13/2300
Spirit nagas are malicious, evil creatures. Their gaze has the effect of
a Charm Person spell, their bite is poison, and they cast both Magic-
User spells (4/2/1) and Cleric spells (2/1). A sample spell selection for
a spirit naga might be: Magic-User spells level 1: Charm Person x2,
Magic Missile, Sleep; level 2: Mirror Image, Web; level 3: Protection
from Normal Missiles. Cleric spells level 1: Cure Light Wounds x2;
level 2: Silence 15-foot Radius. Such nagas are from 10 to 20 feet in
length, and have a human head.
 
Naga, Water
Hit Dice: 7
Armor Class: 5 [14]
Attacks: Bite (1d4 + poison)
Saving Throw: 9
Special: Poison, spells.
Move: 12/20 (swimming)
Alignment: Any
Challenge Level/XP: 10/1400
Water nagas might be of any alignment. They do not ordinarily have
human heads, but like the guardian nagas they will have some physi-
cal attributes separating them clearly from normal serpents. In the case
of water nagas, this might be the color of the scales or the presence of
flowing beard-like fins, perhaps. Water nagas are from 10 to 15 feet
long. Water nagas cast Magic-User spells (4/2/1). A sample spell se-
lection for a water naga might be: level 1: Charm Person x2, Magic
Missile, Sleep; level 2: Mirror Image, Web; level 3: Protection from
Normal Missiles. 
Nixie
Hit Dice: 1d4 hit points
Armor Class: 7 [12]
Attacks: Weapon (1d6)
Saving Throw: 18
Special: Charm
Move: 6/12 (swimming)
Alignment: Neutrality
Challenge Level/XP: B/10
Nixies are weak water fey creatures.  One in ten of them has the power to cast
a powerful Charm Person (-2 penalty to saving throw) that causes the victim to
walk into the water and join the nixies as their slave for a year. Casting
Dispel Magic against the curse has only a 75% chance of success, and once the
victim is actually in the water the chance drops to 25%. Nixies are ordinarily
friendly , but they are capricious.
Ochre Jelly
Hit Dice: 6
Armor Class: 8 [11]
Attacks: Acid-laden strike (3d4)
Saving Throw: 11
Special: Lightning divides creature
Move: 3
Alignment: Neutrality
Challenge Level/XP: 6/400
Ochre jellies are amorphous oozes that damage opponents with their
acidic surface. They dissolve any adventurers they kill, making a Raise
Dead spell impossible.
Octopus, Giant
Hit Dice: 4
Armor Class: 7 [12]
Attacks: 8
Saving Throw: 13
Special: Jet, Ink
Move: 9 (swimming)
Alignment: Neutrality
Challenge Level/XP: 6/400
After a giant octopus hits with a tentacle, it does 1d6 points of damage
per round, automatically, instead of the initial 1d3. Also, there is a 25%
chance that the tentacle “hit” pinions one of the victim’s limbs (roll
randomly for left/right arms and legs to see which is immobilized). A
giant octopus can jet water out to achieve a movement rate of up to 27,
and can also release a huge cloud of ink to obscure its location. Some
giant octopi might be able to move onto land for short periods of time.
Ogre
Hit Dice: 4+1
Armor Class: 5 [14]
Attacks: Weapon (1d10+1)
Saving Throw: 13
Special: None
Move: 9

Ogres are normally quite stupid, but more intelligent versions might
be encountered here and there.
Ogre Mage
Hit Dice: 5+4
Armor Class: 4 [15]
Attacks: Weapon (1d12)
Saving Throw: 12
Special: Magic use (See below)
Move: 12/18 (flying)
Alignment: Chaos
Challenge Level/XP: 7/600
The ogre mage is an ogre with magic powers, based on Japanese
legend. An ogre mage can fly, turn invisible (per the spell), create a 10-
foot-radius circle of magical darkness, change into human form, cast
Sleep and Charm Person once per day, and cast a Cone of Frost with a
range of 60 feet to a base of 30 feet, causing 8d6 damage to any caught
within (saving throw applies). Western folklore also contains many
examples of shape-shifting, magical ogres (the most famous example
being the one in Puss-in-Boots), so there might be many different
interpretations of magical ogres whether or not they are called “ogre
mage.”
Orc
Hit Dice: 1
Armor Class: 6 [14]
Attacks: Weapon, usually spear (1d6) or scimitar (1d8)
Saving Throw: 17
Special: None
Move: 12
Alignment: Chaos
Challenge Level/XP: 1/15
Orcs are stupid, brutish humanoids that gather in tribes of hundreds.
Most are subterranean dwellers, and fight with a penalty of -1 in
sunlight. Occasionally, war-bands or even entire tribes of orcs issue
forth from their caverns to raid and pillage by night. Orcish leaders are
great brutes with additional hit dice, and magic-using shamans may
also be found in the larger tribes. Orcish tribes hate each other, and will
fight savagely unless restrained by a powerful and feared commander,
such as a Chaotic high priest or an evil sorcerer.
Owlbear
Hit Dice: 5+1
Armor Class: 5 [14]
Attacks: 2 claws (1d6), 1 bite (2d6)
Saving Throw: 12
Special: Hug for additional 2d8 if to-hit roll is 18+
Move: 12
Alignment: Neutrality
Challenge Level/XP: 5/240
Owlbears have the body of a bear but the beak of an owl, with some
feathers on the head and places on the body as well. On an attack roll of
18+ (natural roll) with its claws, the owlbear grabs its victim and hugs
it for an additional 2d8 points of damage.
Pegasus
Hit Dice: 4
Armor Class: 6 [13]
Attacks: 2 hooves (1d8)
Saving Throw: 13
Special: None
Move: 24/48 (flying)
Alignment: Law
Challenge Level/XP: 4/120
Pegasi are winged horses. Most have feathered wings, but some might
have bat wings and some might be evil—at the Referee’s discretion.
Piercer
Hit Dice: 1 to 4
Armor Class: 3 [16]
Attacks: 1 drop/pierce (1d6 per HD)
Saving Throw: 17, 16, 14, or 13
Special: Drop from ceiling
Move: 1
Alignment: Neutrality
Challenge Level/XP: 1 HD (1/15), 2 HD (2/30), 3 HD (3/60), 4 HD (4/120)
Piercers resemble stalactites, and drop from cavern ceilings to pierce
their victims. After falling (and feeding), they crawl slowly back to the
ceiling in order to attack again. Note that the damage inflicted by a
piercer is 1d6 per hit die of the creature.
Purple Worm
Hit Dice: 15
Armor Class: 6 [13]
Attacks: Bite (2d12), sting (1d8)
Saving Throw: 3
Special: Poison sting, swallows whole
Move: 9
Alignment: Neutrality
Challenge Level/XP: 17/3,500
Purple worms are massive annelids that grow 40 ft and more in length,
and sometimes exceed ten feet in width. They are subterranean, chew-
ing tunnels in rock (or through sand, in deserts, where they are a tan
color). These beasts swallow their prey whole on a roll 4 higher than the
needed number, or if the worm rolls double the number required to hit.
They can swallow anything the size of a horse or smaller. In addition to
the worm’s dreaded bite, it has a poison stinger on its tail, the length of
a sword and just as deadly even from the piercing wound it inflicts. In
addition, the poison injected by the stinger is lethal if the victim fails a
saving throw. What prey the purple worms once hunted with such natu-
ral weaponry (or perhaps still do, in deep places), must have been ter-
rifying indeed. Aquatic versions of the purple worm might also exist.
Rakshasa
Hit Dice: 7
Armor Class: -4 [23]
Attacks: 2 claws (1d3) 1 bite (1d6)
Saving Throw: 9
Special: Illusory appearance, special magic resistance, spells
Move: 15
Alignment: Chaos
Challenge Level/XP: 12/2,000
Rakshasas are evil spirits from Indian mythology. Their true form is
that of a demon with the head of a tiger or other predatory animal, but
by magical illusion they always appear to others in a friendly or non-
threatening form. Rakshasas can only be affected by the most powerful
of spells (level 8 or 9), and they can only be hit with magical weapons.
Crossbow bolts that have been blessed by a Cleric are the bane of the
rakshasa – such bolts are treated as +3 weapons against them.  Raksha-
sas are minor spell casters, able to cast Magic-User spells (3/2/1) and
Cleric spells (1 Level-1 spell). Typical spells for a rakshasa might be:
Magic-User level 1: Magic Missile x3; level 2: Mirror Image, Web;
level 3: Fly
Cleric level 1: Cure Light Wounds
Rat, Giant
Hit Dice: 1d4 hit points
Armor Class: 7 [12]
Attacks: Bite (1d3)
Saving Throw: 18
Special: 5% are diseased
Move: 12
Alignment: Neutrality
Challenge Level/XP: A/5
Giant rats are often found in dungeons, and are about the size of a cat,
or perhaps a lynx. The bite of some (1 in 20) giant rats causes disease.
A saving throw is allowed (versus poison). The effects of the disease
are decided by the Referee.
Rat, Giant

Alignment: Neutrality unless intelligent (Chaos)
Challenge Level/XP: 4/240
Giant rats (monstrously huge) are often found in dungeons, and are
vicious predators the size of a wolf. The bite of some (1 in 20) giant rats
causes disease. A saving throw is allowed (versus poison). The effects
of the disease are decided by the Referee.
Roc

Armor Class: 4 [15]
Attacks: Bite (3d12), 2 claws (3d6)
Saving Throw: 3
Special: None
Move: 3/30 flying)
Alignment: Neutrality or Law
Challenge Level/XP: 12/2,000
Rocs are the mythological great birds of legend, large enough to prey
upon elephants. They can be trained as fledglings to serve as steeds,
so roc eggs or fledglings would be a prize indeed, worth great sums
of gold. Rocs might grow as large as 18 HD, with commensurately
increased statistics.
Salamander
Hit Dice: 7
Armor Class: 5 [14] (torso); 3 [16] (serpent body)
Attacks: Touch and constrict (2d8 + 1d6 heat), 1 weapon (1d6)
Saving Throw: 9
Special: Heat, constrict
Move: 9
Alignment: Chaos
Challenge Level/XP: 8/800
Salamanders are intelligent creatures of the elemental planes of fire. They
have the upper body of a human and the lower body of a snake, and give
off tremendous, intense heat. The very touch of a salamander deals 1d6
hit points of fire damage, and they wrap their tails around foes to cause an
additional 2d8 points of crushing damage per round as the victim writhes
in the deadly heat of the serpentine coils. The salamander’s human torso is
AC 5 [14], and the armored serpent-tail is AC 3 [16]. Salamanders cannot
be enslaved in the same manner djinn and efreet might be.
Sea Monster
Hit Dice: 30
Armor Class: 2 [17]
Attacks: Bite (4d10)
Saving Throw: 3
Special: Swallow whole
Move: 0/18 (swimming)
Alignment: Neutrality
Challenge Level/XP: 30/8,400
Sea monsters generally resemble bizarre fish, long-necked monsters
with seal-like bodies, or massive eels, although virtually all have a hide
of incredibly tough scales. In general, their appearance is quite varied,
for there does not appear to be a particular “species” of sea monster. Sea
monsters swallow their prey whole, like sea serpents: if the attack roll is
4 over the required number (or a natural 20), the victim is swallowed,
will die in an hour, and will be fully digested within a day. Sea monsters
are not generally venomous. They are generally encountered underwater;
unlike sea serpents, they seldom venture to the surface.
Sea Serpent
Hit Dice: 15
Armor Class: 6 [13]
Attacks: Bite (2d12)
Saving Throw: 3
Special: Swallow whole
Move: 0/20 (swimming)
Alignment: Neutrality
Challenge Level/XP: 17/3,500
A fully-grown sea serpent is approximately 50 feet in length, and will
swallow a person whole on any attack roll in which the die rolled is
4 or more over the required number, and always if the die roll is a
20. Swallowed victims will be dead within an hour, and fully digested
within one day. Some sea serpents are also venomous, in which case the
CL/XP is 19/4,100.
Shadow
Hit Dice: 3+3
Armor Class: 7 [12]
Attacks: 1 touch (1d4 + Str drain)
Saving Throw: 14
Special: Drains 1 Str with hit, can only be hit by magical weapons

Challenge Level/XP: 4/120
Shadowsmayormaynotbeundeadcreatures:theyareimmunetoSleepand
Charm,buttheRefereemaydecidewhethertheyareundeadcreaturessubject
to turning or whether they are some horrible “other” thing: a manifestation,
perhaps, or a creature from another dimension (or gaps in the dimensions).
Shadows are dark and resemble actual shadows, though they may be even
darker in coloration. They are not corporeal, and can only be harmed with
magical weapons or by spells. Their chill touch drains one point of Strength
with a successful hit, and if a victim is brought to a Strength attribute of 0, he
or she is transformed into a new shadow. If the person does not come to such
a dark ending, then Strength points return after 90 minutes (9 turns).
Shambling Mound
Hit Dice: 7 to 12
Armor Class: 1 [18]
Attacks: 2 fists (2d8)
Saving Throw: 9, 8, 6, 5, 4, or 3
Special: Immunities, enfold and suffocate victims.
Move: 6

Challenge Level/XP: HD 7 (10/1400); HD 8 (11/1700); HD 9 (12/2000); HD 10 (13/2300); HD 11 (14/2600); HD 12 (15/2900)
Shambling mounds are moving plants, huge masses of slimy vegeta-
tion that shamble through swamps and marshes looking for prey. They
have a roughly bipedal shape, with two ‘legs’ and two ‘arms.’
Shambling mounds are immune to fire because of their slimy, wet bod-
ies. They take only half damage from cold, and half damage from weap-
ons of any kind. Electricity causes a shambling mound to gain one hit die.
If a shambling mound hits with both arms, the victim is enfolded into the
slimy body and will suffocate in 2d4 melee rounds unless freed.
Shrieker
Hit Dice: 3
Armor Class: 7 [12]
Attacks: None
Saving Throw: 14
Special: Shriek
Move: 1
Alignment: Neutrality
Challenge Level/XP: 3/60
Shriekers are huge mushrooms with tough, fibrous bodies. They do not
physically attack, but if light shines on them (or within about 30 feet) or if
anything moves near them (within about 10 feet), they emit a high-pitched
shriekingnoise.Thisnoisecauses1hpdamageperround(savingthrowapplies)
to anyone nearby (within 30 feet).The true danger of shriekers is that they tend
to summon wandering monsters. If they are attacked with missile weapons,
they will attempt to shuffle away, although they do not move very fast.
Skeleton

Armor Class: 5 [14]
Attacks: No normal attack
Saving Throw: 13
Special: Transparent, paralysis
Move: 12
Alignment: Neutrality
Challenge Level/XP: 6/400
Perhaps the most dangerous of wandering monsters, slithering
trackers are a form of transparent slug and may be related to gelati-
nous cubes. They are difficult to see (10% chance for a person to
spot it, and he may lose sight of it again in the next round). Unless
they are starving, they do not attack moving prey (5% chance to be
starving). Instead, they follow the potential prey until it sleeps or
camps. They can ooze under doors and through fairly small cracks,
so even a barricaded room with a closed door is probably not safe.
When it attacks, the victim must make a saving throw or be para-
lyzed by the slitherer’s secretions. A paralyzed victim will be sucked
dry of all body fluids in 5 turns (50 minutes), losing 20% of hit
points each 10 minutes.
Slug, Giant
Hit Dice: 12
Armor Class: 8 [11]
Attacks: Bite (1d12) or acid
Saving Throw: 3
Special: Spit acid (6d6)
Move: 6
Alignment: Neutrality
Challenge Level/XP: 13/2,300
These tremendously large masses of slimy, rubbery flesh are completely
immune to blunt weapons. In addition to their powerful bite, giant slugs
can spit their acidic saliva at one target at a time. The base range for
spitting is 60 feet, and within this range the slug’s spittle will be 50%
likely to hit (no other to-hit roll required). For every additional 10 feet
of range, the chance to hit decreases by 10%. On its first spitting attack,
the slug only has a 10% chance to hit within 60 feet, and no chance of
hitting beyond that range. Some giant slugs might have more or less
virulent acidity, thus changing the damage inflicted.
Spectre
Hit Dice: 7
Armor Class: 2 [17]
Attacks: Spectral weapon or touch (1d8 + level drain)
Saving Throw: 9
Special: Level drain (2 levels) with hit
Move: 15/30 (flying)
Alignment: Chaos
Challenge Level/XP: 9/1,100
Spectres are wraith-like undead creatures without corporeal bodies.
When a specter hits an opponent, with either hand or weapon, the touch
drains two levels from the victim. Only magical weapons can damage
a specter. In some cases, these terrifying creatures may be mounted
upon living beasts, if the beasts have been trained to tolerate proximity
to the undead. Any being killed (or drained below level 0) by a specter
becomes a specter as well, a pitiful thrall to its creator.
Spider, Giant (1HD)
Hit Dice: 1+1
Armor Class: 8 [11]
Attacks: Bite (1 hp) + poison
Saving Throw: 17
Special: Poison (+2 save or die)
Move: 9
Alignment: Neutrality
Challenge Level/XP: 3/60
1ft diameter. Giant spiders are aggressive hunters.
Spider, Giant (2HD)
Hit Dice: 2+2
Armor Class: 6 [13]
Attacks: Bite (1d6) + poison
Saving Throw: 16
Special: Poison (+1 save or die), surprise
Move: 18
Alignment: Neutrality unless intelligent (Chaos)
Challenge Level/XP: 5/240
4ft diameter. Giant spiders are aggressive hunters. Man-sized giant spiders surprise
on a roll of 1–5 on a d6, being able to hide well in shadows.
Spider, Giant (4HD)
Hit Dice: 4+2
Armor Class: 4 [15]
Attacks: Bite (1d6+2) + poison
Saving Throw: 13
Special: Poison (save or die), webs
Move: 4
Alignment: Chaos
Challenge Level/XP: 7/600
6ft diameter. Giant spiders are aggressive hunters. Greater giant spiders
are web builders. Webs spun by giant spiders require a saving throw to
avoid becoming stuck. Those who make a saving throw can fight in and
move (5 ft per round) through the webs.
Spider, Giant Phase
Hit Dice: 2+2
Armor Class: 3 [16]
Attacks: Bite (1d6) + poison
Saving Throw: 16
Special: Poison (+1 save or die), phase shifting
Move: 18
Alignment: Neutrality
Challenge Level/XP: 6/400
4ft diameter. Giant spiders are aggressive hunters. Phase spiders can shift out of
phase with their surroundings (so they can be attacked only be ethereal
creatures), only to come back into phase later for an attack.
Squid, Giant
Hit Dice: 6
Armor Class: 3 [16] (body shell), 7 [12] tentacles and front
Attacks: 10 (1d3)
Saving Throw: 11
Special: Jet, Ink, Constrict
Move: 9 (swimming)
Alignment: Neutrality
Challenge Level/XP: 9/1100
After a giant squid hits with a tentacle, it does 1d6 points of damage
per round, automatically, instead of the initial 1d3. Also, there is
a 25% chance that the tentacle “hit” pinions one of the victim’s
limbs (roll randomly for left/right arms and legs to see which is
immobilized). A giant squid can jet water out to achieve a movement
rate of up to 27, and can also release a huge cloud of ink to obscure
its location. If a giant squid wraps its tentacles around a ship, the
ship will be crushed in 10 rounds, taking damage throughout that
time.
Stirge
Hit Dice: 1+1
Armor Class: 7 [12]
Attacks: “Sting” (1d3 + blood drain)
Saving Throw: 17
Special: Drain blood 1d4/round
Move: 3/18 (when flying)
Alignment: Neutrality
Challenge Level/XP: 1/15
Resembling small, feathered, winged anteaters, stirges have a
proboscis which they jab into their prey to drain blood. After a stirge’s
first hit, it drains blood automatically at a rate of 1d4 hp per round.
Tick, Giant
Hit Dice: 3
Armor Class: 4 [15]
Attacks: Bite (1d4)
Saving Throw: 14
Special: Drains blood
Move: 3
Alignment: Neutrality
Challenge Level/XP: 3/60
Giant ticks drain blood at a rate of 4 hit points per round after a
successful hit. Their bite causes disease, which will kill the victim in
2d4 days. (Cure Disease spells will remove the infection.) A giant tick
can be forced off a victim by fire or by simply killing it.
Titan
Hit Dice: 16 HD+1d6 HD
Armor Class: 2 [17] to –3 [22]
Attacks: Weapon (2d8)
Saving Throw: 3
Special: Spells
Move: 21
Alignment: Any
Challenge Level/XP: 17 HD (19/4,100), 18+ HD (Add 1 challenge level and 300 XP per additional HD over 17)
Titans are mythological creatures, almost as powerful as gods. A
titan has 2 Magic-User spells of each spell level from 1st-level spells
to 7th-level spells, and 2 Cleric spells of each spell level from 1st to
7th. The Referee might choose to substitute other magical abilities for
spells—these creatures vary considerably in powers and personalities
from one to the next.
One possible spell list for a titan might include the following Magic-
User and Cleric spells:
Magic-User: Charm Person (1), Sleep (1), Invisibility (2), Mirror
Image (2), Fireball (3), Fly (3), Polymorph Other (4), Confusion
(4), Conjure Elemental (5), Feeblemind (5), Anti-magic Shell (6),
Stone to Flesh (6), Limited Wish (7), Power Word Stun (7).
Cleric: Light (1), Protection From Evil (1), Hold Person (2),
Speak with Animals (2), Cure Disease (3), Dispel Magic (3), Cure
Serious Wounds (4), Neutralize Poison (4), Finger of Death (5),
Quest (5), Blade Barrier (6), Word of Recall (6), Earthquake (7),
Resurrection (Raise Dead Fully) (7).
Trapper Beast
Hit Dice: 10 to 12
Armor Class: 3 [16]
Attacks: 1 enfold
Saving Throw: 5, 4, or 3
Special: Immunities; enfold and smother
Move: 1
Alignment: Neutrality
Challenge Level/XP: 10 HD (11/1,700), 11 HD (12/2,000), 12 HD (13/2,300)
Trapper-beasts are large manta-like creatures resembling the stone
floors of the subterranean areas where they live. When prey steps onto
the trapper’s body, it whips up its wings to enfold and smother its vic-
tims (to a maximum of four). Death occurs in 7 melee rounds. Cold
does not damage them, and fire inflicts only half damage.
Treant
Hit Dice: 6 HD + 1d6 HD
Armor Class: 2 [17]
Attacks: 2 strikes (2d6, 3d6, or 4d6)
Saving Throw: 9, 8, 6, 5, 4, or 3
Special: Control trees
Move: 12
Alignment: Neutrality
Challenge Level/XP: 7 HD (7/600), 8 HD (8/800), 9 HD (9/1,100), 10 HD (10/1,400), 11 HD (11/1,700) 12 HD (12/2,000)
Treants are tree-like protectors and “shepherds” of forest trees.
Depending upon their size, they have different hit dice and do different
amounts of damage: treants of 7 to 8 hit dice inflict 2d6 points of
damage with each strike of their branch-like hands, treants of 9–10 hit
dice inflict 3d6 points, and treants of 11–12 hit dice inflict 4d6 points.
All treants can “wake” trees within 60 ft, allowing them to walk at a
rate of 3, and possibly to attack. (No more than two trees at a time can
be awake at the behest of a single treant.)
Troll
Hit Dice: 6+3
Armor Class: 4 [15]
Attacks: 2 claws (1d4), 1 bite (1d8)
Saving Throw: 11
Special: Regenerates
Move: 12
Alignment: Chaos
Challenge Level/XP: 8/800
Trolls are as tall as ogres, and just as strong. Unlike ogres, however,
they attack with claws and teeth instead of weapons. Trolls regenerate,
which is to say that any damage inflicted upon them heals within
minutes (3 hit points per round). The only way to utterly kill a troll is
to submerse it in acid or burn it. Trolls can even re-grow lopped-off
heads and limbs.
Unicorn
Hit Dice: 4+5
Armor Class: 2 [17]
Attacks: 2 hoofs (1d8), 1 horn (1d8)
Saving Throw: 13
Special: Magic resistance (25%), double damage for charge, teleport
Move: 24
Alignment: Law
Challenge Level/XP: 5/240
Unicorns are generally shy and benevolent creatures, who will allow
only a chaste maiden to approach them. They can teleport once per
day to a distance of 360 ft, with a rider. The unicorn’s horn has healing
properties, according to legend. (The details of this, if any, are left to the
Referee). There is considerable room to create variant sorts of unicorns:
evil ones, flying ones, etc.
Vampire
Hit Dice: 7–9
Armor Class: 2 [17]
Attacks: Bite (1d10 + level drain)
Saving Throw: 9, 8, or 6
Special: See below
Move: 12/18 (flying)
Alignment: Chaos
Challenge Level/XP: 7 HD (9/1,100), 8 HD (10/1,400), 9 HD (11/1,700)
Vampires are some of the most powerful of undead creatures. They
can only be hit with magic weapons, and when “killed” in this way they
turn into a gaseous form, returning to their coffins.
They regenerate at a rate of 3 hit points per round, can turn into a
gaseous form or into a giant bat at will, and can summon a horde of
bats or 3d6 wolves out from the night. Looking into a vampire’s eyes
necessitates a saving throw at -2, or the character is charmed (per the
Charm Person spell). Most terrifyingly, a vampire’s bite drains two
levels from the victim.
Fortunately, vampires have some weaknesses. They can be killed
(though these are the only known methods) by immersing them in
running water, exposing them to sunlight, or driving a wooden stake
through the heart. They retreat from the smell of garlic, the sight of
a mirror, or the sight of “good” holy symbols. Any human killed by a
vampire becomes a vampire under the control of its creator.
This description will be recognized easily as the “Dracula” type
of vampire. Many other possibilities for vampires exist in folklore:
Chinese vampires, for instance, and blood-drinkers more feral than
intelligent. Plus, other cultural templates with different attributes could
be created—how about an ancient Egyptian mummified vampire, or an
Aztec vampire?
Wight
Hit Dice: 3
Armor Class: 5 [14]
Attacks: Claw (1 hp + level drain)
Saving Throw: 14
Special: Level drain (1 level) with hit, can only be hit by magical or
silver weapons
Move: 9
Alignment: Chaos
Challenge Level/XP: 5/240
Wights live in tombs, graveyards, and burial mounds (barrows). They
are undead, and thus not affected by sleep or charm spells. Wights
are immune to all non-magical weapons, with the exception of silver
weapons. Any human killed or completely drained of levels by a wight
becomes a wight.
Will-o-the-Wisp
Hit Dice: 9
Armor Class: -8 [27]
Attacks: Shock (2d6)
Saving Throw: 6
Special: Change appearance, lightning
Move: 18
Alignment: Chaos
Challenge Level/XP: 10/1400
Will o’ the wisps are phantom-like shapes of eerie light, creatures that
live in dangerous places and try to lure travelers into quicksand, off the
edges of cliffs, etc. They usually inhabit swamps or high moors. They
can brighten or dim their own luminescence, and change their shapes
as well, to appear as a group of lights, a wisp of light, or in the glowing
wraithlike shape of a human (often female). They will generally depart
if the attempt to lead victims into danger fails, but if they are attacked
they can defend themselves with violent shocks of lightning-like power.
These creatures are intelligent, and can be forced to reveal the location
of their treasure hoards.
Wolf
Hit Dice: 2+2
Armor Class: 7 [12]
Attacks: Bite (1d4+1)
Saving Throw: 16
Special: None
Move: 18
Alignment: Neutrality
Challenge Level/XP: 2/30
Wolves are pack hunters, and may be found in large numbers. Male
wolves weigh from 80 to 100 pounds.
Wolf, Worg
Hit Dice: 4
Armor Class: 6 [13]
Attacks: Bite (1d6+1)
Saving Throw: 13
Special: None
Move: 18
Alignment: Chaos
Challenge Level/XP: 4/120
Worgs are large, intelligent, and evil wolves. They may have
supernatural origins.
Wraith
Hit Dice: 4
Armor Class: 3 [16]
Attacks: Touch (1d6 + level drain)
Saving Throw: 13
Special: Level drain (1 level) with hit
Move: 9
Alignment: Chaos
Challenge Level/XP: 6/400
Wraiths are powerful wights, immune to all non-magical weapons
other than silver ones (which inflict only half damage). Arrows are
particularly ineffective against them, for even magical and silver arrows
inflict only one hit point of damage per hit. Wraiths can be found riding
well-trained battle steeds or more unusual mounts that will tolerate their
presence.
Wyvern
Hit Dice: 8
Armor Class: 3 [16]
Attacks: Bite (2d8) or sting (1d6)
Saving Throw: 8
Special: Poison sting
Move: 6/24 (flying)
Alignment: Neutrality
Challenge Level/XP: 9/1,100
A wyvern is a two-legged form of dragon. These creatures are smaller
and less intelligent than true four-legged dragons, not to mention that
they do not have a breath weapon. Each wyvern has a poisonous sting at
the end of its tails. However, they are not coordinated enough to attack
with both bite and sting in a single round. In any given round, a wyvern
is 60% likely to use its tail, which can lash out to the creature’s front
even farther than its head can reach.
Mold, Yellow
Attacks: 1d6 damage if touched
Special: Poisonous spores
Challenge Level/XP: 3/60
Yellow mold is a subterranean fungus; it neither moves nor attacks.
However, if it is poked or struck, it may (50% chance) release a cloud
(roughly 10 feet in diameter) of poisonous spores,. Failing a saving
throw against the spores means that the character dies a rather horrible
death. Even just touching yellow mold inflicts 1d6 points of acid
damage on the creature doing the touching. These growths can be
destroyed with fire.
Yeti
Hit Dice: 5
Armor Class: 6[13]
Attacks: 2 fists (1d6)
Saving Throw: 12
Special: Immune to cold, hug, fear.
Move: 14
Alignment: Chaos
Challenge Level/XP: 7/600
Yetis are the “Bigfoot” creatures of the arctic and the high mountains.
If a yeti strikes the same opponent with both fists, it bear-hugs for an
additional 2d6 points of damage. Anyone caught in the yeti’s arms like
this must make a saving throw or be paralyzed with fear for 1d3 rounds,
during which time the yeti hits automatically. Yetis are very intelligent,
and can be quite malevolent. They are immune to normal and magical
cold.
Zombie
Hit Dice: 2
Armor Class: 8 [11], or 7 [12] with shield
Attacks: Weapon or strike (1d8)
Saving Throw: 16
Special: Immune to sleep and charm spells
Move: 6
Alignment: Neutrality
Challenge Level/XP: 2/30
Zombies are mindless creatures, the walking dead. (These are merely
animated corpses, not carriers of any sort of undead contagion as are
ghouls.) If their Undeath is contagious, they should be worth a few
more experience points than described here, and if a single hit from a
zombie causes contagion or any other sort of disease, they should be
worth considerably more experience. However, the standard zombie is
simply a corpse animated to do its creator’s bidding.
