##The acolytes are clerics in the service of Orcus.
##They typically wear black chain mail, dark grey
##robes, and simple sandals. They often decorate
##their shields with the unholy symbol of He-Who-
##Must-Not-Be-Named.
##
##For every 3 acolytes encountered, there will be a
##mid-level cleric of second, third, or fourth level
##(d6: 1-2 second, 3-4 third, 5-6 fourth level).
##First level acolytes can cast one spell from the fol-
##lowing list: Cause Light Wounds, Darkness, or Pro-
##tection from Good. They are armed with a mace
##and wear studded leather and carry a wooden
##shield (AC 6). They have 2-20sp each.
##
##Spells for clerics beyond first level are subject to
##level and Referee’s discretion. These priests carry
##a mace and wear chainmail and a metal shield
##(AC 4). There is a 10% chance that one of these
##three items is magical (+1). They carry 5-50gp.
##
##In addition, if a mid-level cleric is present roll a d6 and consult the
##following table to determine the undead the cleric controls.  If a fourth
##level acolyte is present, there is a 25% chance that s/he possesses
##a Gehennian Goat.

Amber Jelly
No. Enc: 3d6
Alignment: Neutral
Movement: 90’ (30’)
Armor Class: 5
Hit Dice: 4
Attacks: 1
Damage: pseudopod (d6+slow) or 15' mucus (d6+slow)
Special: immune cold, fire divides
Save: F4
Morale: 12
Hoard Class: None
XP: 75
Amber jellies are glistening, transparent amoebae
of a densely gelatinous and vaguely ovoid nature.

They are most notable for their deep sickly yellow
color. Often found in small groups, amber jellies
work together to trap their prey.

In combat, an amber jelly can strike with a pseu-
dopod, but it prefers a ranged attack by spewing
a sticky yellow mucilage (both attacks do 1d6) up
to 15 feet. Regardless of its means of attack, tar-
gets must save (Paralyze) when struck. If the victim
fails, it is Slowed (as per the spell) by the sticky
ichor for three turns (the effects of multiple hits are
cumulative). By working in groups, amber jellies
can be quite deadly. They prefer to stick to ceil-
ings, high walls, or alcoves where they can shoot
their mucilage repeatedly from safety.

Amber jelly mucilage may be dissolved by alco-
hol. It is immune to cold and fire damage prompts
an immediate subdivision into two jellies (each
with half hit points and 2 HD).

Mold, Amber
No. Enc: 1
Alignment: Neutral
Movement: 0
Armor Class: Always hit
Hit Dice: 1hp
Attacks: 1
Damage: Stinking Cloud
Special: monster check, fire destroys
Save: F2
Morale: Nil
Hoard Class: None
XP: 45
Amber mold appears much like yellow mold. A
colony normally covers a patch of floor, wall, or
ceiling. The spores of amber mold contain small
gas pockets. When released they have the effect
similar to a temporary (1 turn) Stinking Cloud, except that the nausea induced lasts for
2d4+1 rounds after leaving the affected area and
the intensity of the choking and vomiting may
provoke a random monster check (Referee’s discretion). Amber mold can be destroyed by fire.

##Black Tentacles
##No. Enc: 1
##Alignment: Chaotic
##Movement: 60’ (20’)
##Armor Class: 3
##Hit Dice: 10
##Attacks: 6
##Damage: 6x tentacles(d8)
##Special: constrict, maw(4d6)
##Save: F10
##Morale: 12
##Hoard Class: XXII
##XP: 2225
##A fearsome opponent, black tentacles are a mass
##of ten wiggling, black, octopus-like limbs attached
##to a main body. The body is comprised of a large
##maw that possesses rows of sharp teeth. Six of the
##tentacles are used to move and/or attack while
##the remaining four possess bulging eyestalks at
##their terminal end.
##
##With each of its six attacks, black tentacles can
##either smack (1d8) or constrict (1d8) an opponent.
##If a black tentacles manages to constrict, its vic-
##tim is allowed a saving throw (Paralyze) at the end
##of the round to break free. If unsuccessful, the
##black tentacles will draw its victim into its maw
##causing an automatic 4d6 points of damage the
##next round.
##
##The remaining four tentacles possess eyestalks at
##their tip and allow the black tentacles to see and
##guide its attacks. If specifically targeted, the ten-
##tacles, including eyestalk-tentacles, each possess
##an armor class of 0 and 8 hit points. Black tenta-
##cles will normally retreat before their final eyestalk
##is cut off. It will regenerate its limbs in 1d4+2 weeks.
##Black tentacles must stay submerged in water the
##majority of the time. They abhor light and will typi-
##cally target those with light sources, followed by
##good-aligned clerics and warriors.

Ghast, Barrow
No. Enc: 1d2
Alignment: Chaotic
Movement: 150’ (50’)
Armor Class: 2
Hit Dice: 7
Attacks: 3
Damage: 1d6/1d6/1d8 (paralyze)
Special: +2 magic to-hit, infection, control undead, stench, immune mental
Save: F6
Morale: 10
Hoard Class: XVII
XP: 1200
The barrow, or greater, ghast can only be hit by +2 magical weapons.  Their
charnel stench is so powerful that anyone nearby (about 10ft) must make
a saving throw or suffer a -2 penalty on attack rolls. Their attacks cause paralysis
if the victim fails a saving throw.

Moreover, wounds inflicted by the claws or bite of a barrow ghast are
immediately infected. They resist magical healing and require 10 times the
normal amount of time to heal naturally. A Cure Disease spell will allow for
normal and magical healing of wounds caused by a barrow ghast. Bar- row ghasts
can control undead of 4 or fewer HD and always have a pack of standard
ghasts (1d4+1) and ghouls (2d4+2) serving them. These undead servants cannot
be turned in the pres- ence of their barrow ghast leader.

Finally, some barrow ghasts, who were magic- users, clerics, or fighters in
life, retain some of their abilities in death, subject to the discretion of
the Referee. Like all undead, they are unaffected by mind-influencing spells.

Barrow Guardian
No. Enc: 1d4
Alignment: Neutral
Movement: 20’
Armor Class: 3
Hit Dice: 3
Attacks: 1
Damage: 1d6
Special: stick weapons, half dmg weapons, immune mental
Save: F3
Morale: 12
Hoard Class: None
XP: 350
The barrow guardian is similar to a caryatid col-
umn, but they are specific to Barrowmaze. They
appear as stone statues, pillars, or columns in the
form of stately male warriors. Barrow guardians are
often used to guard crypts and tombs of import.
They are inanimate until someone disturbs the
tomb they have been assigned to protect.

With each hit on a barrow guardian, the weapon
must make a saving throw (Paralyze, using the
character’s unmodified save) or become stuck in
the statue. Bonuses for magical weapons apply to
the save and weapons may be retrieved after
combat.

Barrow Guardian, Greater
No. Enc: 1d4
Alignment: Neutral
Movement: 20’
Armor Class: 1
Hit Dice: 6
Attacks: 1
Damage: 1d8+2
Special: 7+MR, stick weapons, shield, half dmg weapons, immune mental
Save: F6
Morale: 12
Hoard Class: None
XP: 650
The greater barrow guardian is similar to the 3 hit
die barrow guardian insofar as they appear as
statues or columns of helmed male warriors.
However, greater barrow guardians are con-
structed with stronger enchantments and possess
greater HD. They have a 35% resistance to
magic and carry a large stone shield that provides
an improved armor class.

Similar to the 3 HD version, weapons can also
become stuck in the greater barrow guardian.

Harpy, Barrow
No. Enc: 1d6 (2d4)
Alignment: Chaotic
Movement: 60’(20’)
Armor Class: 5
Hit Dice: 3
Attacks: 3
Damage: 2 claw (d6), 1 weapon
Special: +2 vs magic, paralyzing shriek, persistent
Save: F3
Morale: 7
Hoard Class: XX
XP: 100
These despicable creatures resemble harpies but
are skinnier and more wretched. Unlike common
harpies, their appearance and feathers suggest a
lineage to vultures. Instead of fresh meat, they
prefer to feed on carrion and thus frequent grave
sites and battlefields.

Barrow harpies attack three times per round, in-
cluding 2 claw attacks (1d6/1d6) and by weapon
type. They prefer basic weapons and care little for
their upkeep. Barrow harpies are often seen at-
tacking with gnarled clubs, or rusty daggers, or
chipped swords.

Instead of charming their foes, their shriek is so
frightening all those who hear it must save (Para-
lyze) or become immobilized with fear for 9 turns
(as per the spell Hold Person). A successful save
will not require additional saves during an encoun-
ter. Barrow harpies have an innate magical re-
sistance and receive +2 on all saves versus magic.

Although they have relatively low morale and are
quick to flee combat, barrow harpies are persis-
tent and may return to battle if they can gather
greater numbers. They often keep giant vultures
as pets and guardians.

Mummy, Barrow
No. Enc: 1d2
Alignment: Chaotic
Movement: 60’ (20’)
Armor Class: 3
Hit Dice: 7
Attacks: 2
Damage: 2 fists (1d8+d4 freeze)
Special: magic or fire to-hit, touch freezes limb, immune mental, half dmg bludge/pierce
Save: F7
Morale: 12
Hoard Class: XIX
XP: 960

A barrow mummy is stronger and more powerful
than a standard mummy.

These mummies can attack twice per round with
their fists for 1d8 each. Instead of mummy rot, bar-
row mummies possess a freezing touch that does
an additional 1d4 on each successful hit.
Moreover, their freezing touch will paralyze a limb
for 1d4+1 hours unless a successful save is made
(Paralyze). To determine which limb is struck roll
1d4 (1: right arm, 2: left arm, 3: right leg, 4: left leg).
Like all undead, they are unaffected by mind-
influencing spells, Barrow mummies can only be
harmed by magical weapons, spells, and fire-
based attacks.

Wight, Barrow
No. Enc: 1d3
Alignment: Chaotic
Movement: 90’ (30’)
Armor Class: 4
Hit Dice: 6
Attacks: 1
Damage: 1d8+drain
Special: magic or silver to-hit, sight causes insanity, touch drains, immune mental
Save: F6
Morale: 12
Hoard Class: XVIII
XP: 650
Barrow wights are fearsome opponents. They are
similar to normal wights but stronger and more
powerful. They are found near barrows, crypts,
and gravesites. Barrow wights have thin white skin
pulled tight over their bones, and often wear fu-
nerary shrouds that hang in tatters. The eyes of a
barrow wight burn with malevolence for the living.
Any character that meets the gaze of a barrow
wight is struck with insanity unless a save (Spells) is
made. Moreover, the physical touch of a barrow
wight drains one level of experience from its vic-
tim. A humanoid slain by a barrow wight will rise as
a normal wight in 1d6 rounds. Like all undead, bar-
row wights are immune to mind-influencing spells.
Some say barrow wights, similar to mummies, are
interred with canopic jars and that destroying their
vessels can cause them injury.

Brass Jackal
No. Enc: Varies
Alignment: Neutral
Movement: 150’ (50’)
Armor Class: 3
Hit Dice: 2
Attacks: 1
Damage: bite (d8)
Special: +4 vs magic, magic to-hit, immune slash, half damage pierce
Save: F2
Morale: 12
Hoard Class: None
XP: 30
Brass jackals are constructed by high level necro-
mancers of Set, who use them as sentinels and
personal protectors. Constructed of bronze and
black iron, they possess a smooth shell of brassy
armor, and their eyes glow like orbs of red.

In combat, brass jackals bite with sharp metal
teeth for 1d8 hit points of damage. Due to their
magically reinforced metal bodies, these con-
structs can only be struck by magical weapons.
Moreover, they take no damage from slashing
weapons, half damage from piercing weapons,
and full damage from blunt weapons.
They have a +3 bonus to saves against spells cast
directly against them

Mold, Brown
No. Enc: 1
Alignment: Neutral
Movement: 0
Armor Class: Always hit
Hit Dice: 2
Attacks: 1
Damage: drain heat (2d8) all 10'
Special:
Save: F2
Morale: Nil
Hoard Class: None
XP: 45
Brown mold drains the body heat of living crea-
tures that approach within 10 feet. Cold-based
creatures are unaffected. The damage from the
heat drain is 2d8 hit points per round with no sav-
ing throw. If fire is used on brown mold, it will bub-
ble and double its size in 1 round. Brown mold can
only be destroyed through the use of magical
cold.

Pudding, Brown
No. Enc: 1
Alignment: Neutral
Movement: 60’ (20’)
Armor Class: 9
Hit Dice: 9
Attacks: 1
Damage: acid (2d6)
Special: dissolve non-metal, immune slash, slash divides
Save: F9
Morale: 12
Hoard Class: None
XP: 2500
The brown pudding is a subspecies of black pud-
ding. Brown puddings are found most often in
moors and swamps, although they can be en-
countered elsewhere. Brown puddings secrete a
digestive acid that dissolves organic material but
does not affect metal. Any melee hit deals acid
damage to its target. In addition the opponent’s
clothing and non-metal armor dissolve and be-
come useless immediately. Magical non-metal
armor has a 60% chance of survival plus 10% for
each plus of the armor. A wooden weapon that
strikes a brown pudding dissolves immediately with
no saving throw.

Slashing weapons deal no damage to this crea-
ture. Instead, slashing weapons will split the crea-
ture into two identical puddings, each with half of
the original’s current hit points (round down). A
pudding with 10 hit points or less cannot be split
further and dies if reduced to 0 hit points.

Cave Moray
No. Enc: 1d4+2
Alignment: Neutral
Movement: 5’
Armor Class: 4
Hit Dice: 1-6HD
Attacks: 1
Damage: bite (d8)
Special: 3+ surprise, cover
Save: As HD
Morale: 7
Hoard Class: None
XP: 120
Cave morays are a land-based version of their
watery brethren. The males grow about 7 feet
long. They make their lairs underground in the
walls of caves and dungeons. They create their
burrows in high traffic areas, or near water-holes,
where they can surprise their prey.

Although they live individually, groups of cave
morays in the same area will work together to
cross-sect their immediate killing ground. They at-
tack by striking, recoiling, and then striking again.
They surprise opponents on a 1-3. Cave morays
can come in sizes ranging from 1 to 6 HD.


Clockwork, Cobra
No. Enc: 1d4
Alignment: Neutral
Movement: 5’
Armor Class: 2
Hit Dice: 1
Attacks: 1
Damage: bite (d3+poison)
Special: half dmg non-magic
Save: F1
Morale: 12
Hoard Class: Nil
XP: 100
Clockwork cobras are metal constructs used in
crypts to guard precious treasures. They are ani-
mated by magic.

A clockwork cobra is silent when motionless, but
when moving, it emits a repeated Bzzzzzzzzt, click,
click, click series of noises.

Non-magical weapons inflict only half damage on
a clockwork cobra. The cobra’s bite inflicts 1-3 hit
points of damage. In addition, the first two bites
will inject poison. Victims must save (Poison) or die.


Corpse Candle
No. Enc: 1
Alignment: Chaotic
Movement: 20’
Armor Class: 2
Hit Dice: 6
Attacks: 1
Damage: 1d8
Special: incorporeal, invisible, hypnotic, immune mental
Save: F4
Morale: 12
Hoard Class: None
XP: 275
Corpse candles are a vengeful, incorporeal form
of undead. They remain close to the location of
their death and are completely invisible to the na-
ked eye.

They create dim twisting patterns of light similar to candles in darkness.
Those who view the luminescence must save (Spells) or be hypnotized by, and
drawn to, the light. Corpse candles are devious and will attempt to draw
victims into the traps, or toward the den of the monsters, that killed them.
If a victim does indeed die in the trap, their final sight will be the ghastly
visage of the corpse candle reaching towards them. Anyone killed by a corpse
candle has a 10% chance of rising as one in 1d4 rounds.  Like all undead, they
are unaffected by mind- influencing spells.

Coffer Corpse
No. Enc: 1
Alignment: Chaotic
Movement: 60’ (20’)
Armor Class: 7
Hit Dice: 2
Attacks: 1
Damage: choke (1d6)
Special: choke, magic to-hit, turns as 7HD, immune mental, rise/delayed fear
Save: F2
Morale: 12
Hoard Class: XXI
XP: 48
The coffer corpse resembles a zombie but is
turned as a 7 HD creature on the clerical turn
undead table. Like all undead, the coffer corpse
in unaffected by mind influencing spells.
After sustaining 4 hit points of damage or more
the coffer corpse collapses, and appears defeat-
ed. However, normal weapons do no damage to
a coffer corpse and one round after collapsing
the undead creature will rise and continue to at-
tack. All those who watch the coffer corpse rise
must save or flee in panic.  There is a
50% chance fleeing PCs will drop whatever they
are carrying.

If the coffer corpse makes a successful attack it
has wrapped its hands around the neck of its vic-
tim. Each successive round it automatically stran-
gles for an additional 1d6 damage. The grasp of a
coffer corpse cannot be broken.


Crypt Knight
No. Enc: 1d8
Alignment: Chaotic
Movement: 60’ (30’)
Armor Class: 2
Hit Dice: 7
Attacks: 1
Damage: weapon (1d10)
Special: Fear aura, immune mental
Save: F7
Morale: 12
Hoard Class: None
XP: 475
Crypt Knights are all that remain of a secret mar-
tial order – the Black Legion - devoted to Nurgal,
God of the Underworld. When The Tablet of Chaos
was hidden, the order gathered together and will-
ingly allowed their life energy to be drained by
Nurgal’s undead. They rose in death as crypt
knights devoted to the protection of the Dark
God’s great temples and The Tablet of Chaos.

Due to the excruciating nature of their death and
their skeletal appearance, crypt knights radiate
an aura of fear.  Regardless of what weapon they use, crypt
knights strike for 1d10 points of damage.

The symbol of the order is a white skull on a black
rose. This device often decorates their armor
and/or shields. They attack all intruders except
followers of Nurgal. Like all undead, crypt knights
are unaffected by mind-influencing spells.

Crypt Shade
No. Enc: 1d2
Alignment: Chaotic
Movement: 90’ (30’)
Armor Class: 9
Hit Dice: 2
Attacks: 1
Damage: engulf (1d8)
Special: turn as 4HD, immune mental, 1/2 damage other than fire/silver/magic/holy
Save: F2
Morale: 12
Hoard Class: None
XP: 100
This undead creature is a roughly human-shaped
collection of shadows, dust, rotted burial linens,
bone fragments, and other sepulcher debris.

Spawned from chaos and lingering hate, crypt
shades feed on the fear and pain of their victims.
They attack by engulfing victims within the shifting
cloud of grave detritus that gives them shape,
battering victims for 1d8 points of damage.

Crypt shades are turned as 4HD creatures and
possess the undead immunity to sleep and charm.
Physical attacks on a crypt shade inflict only half
damage. They suffer normal damage from fire,
silver, magic, and holy water (Reprinted with per-
mission of Michael Curtis).

Crypt Shade, Greater
No. Enc: 1d2
Alignment: Chaotic
Movement: 90’ (30’)
Armor Class: 4
Hit Dice: 6
Attacks: 1
Damage: engulf(d10)
Special: Fear, turn as 8HD, immune mental, 1/2 damage other than fire/silver/magic/holy
Save: F6
Morale: 12
Hoard Class: XIV
XP: 450
This undead creature is a swirling, roughly human-
shaped assortment of shadows, dust, rotted burial
linens, bones, and other debris. Spawned from
chaos and lingering hate, these monsters feed on
the fear and pain of their victims.

On a successful attack, these undead creatures
engulf a victim within their shifting cloud of grave
detritus. While in this whirling mass victims cannot
escape and are suffocated and battered for 1d10
points of damage per round until the shade is de-
stroyed or turned. In addition, their ghastly semi-
human visage invokes Fear (as per the magic-user
spell) in those who fail their saving throw (Spells).
Greater crypt shades are turned as 8HD crea-
tures. Non-magical attacks on a crypt shade inflict
only half damage. They suffer full damage from
magical weapons, spells, silver, and holy water.
There is a 50% chance that a greater crypt shade
that has been destroyed or turned will reform with-
in 1d4 days. Like all undead, they are unaffected
by mind-influencing spells.


Crypt Thing
No. Enc: 1
Alignment: Neutral
Movement: 60’(20’)
Armor Class: 5
Hit Dice: 6
Attacks: 2
Damage: 2 claws (d6)
Special: teleport
Save: F6
Morale: 12
Hoard Class: None
XP: 500
Not undead.

Crypt things look much like skeletons shrouded in
a black robe. Powerful magic-users create crypt
things to serve as guardians to their tombs or to
protect special treasures. They never leave their
designated tomb and never initiate combat.

If the tomb it guards is disturbed in any way, the
crypt thing will teleport interlopers in a random
direction (d8) away from the tomb they guard
(5d20 feet). Those teleported may attempt to re-
sist. If sufficiently annoyed a crypt thing will teleport tomb-robbers to
a destination in mid-air (or sometimes over a
pool).


Death Knight
No. Enc: 1
Alignment: Chaos
Movement: 60’ (20’)
Armor Class: 0
Hit Dice: 10
Attacks: 2
Damage: 2 weapon (d10+6)
Special: Fear, +1 magic to-hit, 18STR, 3+MR/spell turn, immune mental/turning, command undead, Dispel Magic(18th), Fireball(12d6), Symbol(12th)
Save: F10
Morale: 12
Hoard Class: None
XP: 4000
The death knight is a terrible undead creature. It is
unknown if they achieved their state through a fall
from grace or if they were created by the dark
gods. Death knights carry the equipment they
possessed in life. They often wear ancient magical
platemail and shield, and carry a magical
longsword, mace, or flail.

Death knights have an effective strength of 18,
They possess a magic resistance of 85% and
can only be hit by +1 or better magic weapons.
Any spell that fails to break the knight’s magic re-
sistance is turned on the caster.

The death knight cannot be turned and can
command undead below its HD at will. Death
knights can cast Dispel Magic (1/day), Fire Ball
(1/day), and use a Symbol (1/day). These are cast
at 18th level of magic use.

The voice of a death knight is so hollow and
chilling that all those who hear its voice must save
or flee in Fear.
Like all undead, they are unaffect-
ed by mind-influencing spells.


Elemental, Fountain
No. Enc: 1
Alignment: Chaotic
Movement: Special
Armor Class: 5
Hit Dice: 4
Attacks: Special
Damage: drag/drown
Special: +6 to-hit, immune weapons, 1/2 fire, cold slows
Save: F4
Morale: 12
Hoard Class: XIV, XIII, XII
XP: 400
A water fountain elemental is an elemental crea-
ture that has been bound by a magic-user to a
deep fountain, pool, or cistern for the purpose of
protection or defense.

When provoked, these elementals form a watery
snake-like appendage (in 1d3 rounds) and at-
tempt to drown passersby by striking out at their
opponents as a monster with 6 HD. PCs must
save (Paralyze) or be dragged into the fountain in
one round and face drowning.

As a water-based creature, this elemental takes
only half damage from fire and is Slowed by cold
spells.

##A fire crab appears as a giant crab in most re-
##spects. However, its reddish color and jagged ap-
##pearance distinguish it.
##
##In combat, fire crabs generate intense heat and
##flames rise from their back. A fire crab attacks with
##its two claws, each dealing 1d8 hit points of dam-
##age. In addition, opponents will suffer 1d4 points
##of fire damage on each successful hit.
##
##Fire crabs are immune to fire-based attacks and

Gehennian goats are demonic creatures created
by Orcus. They are matted and shaggy in ap-
pearance. They have twisted horns and dull black
eyes.

Gehennian goats are summoned by Orcus’ fol-
lowers through an unknown ritual.

Gehennian goats follow the commands of their
summoners until they are slain or 666 days pass, at
which time they return to their lair in the under-
world.

They are often used as sentries or in melee sup-
port. Gehennian goats can Detect Invisibility to a
range of 60’ with a 75% chance of success.
In combat, they will either bite for 1d6 points of
damage or they may breath hellfire for 4d6 points
of damage once per day.

##Giant ants are often found in two varieties: work-

##
##Workers are normally three feet long and typically
##have an armor class of 4 and 2 HD. They at-
##tack once per round for 1d6 points of damage.
##Soldiers are normally four feet long and are
##stronger and more resilient. They have an armor
##class of 2 and 3 HD. They attack once per
##round for 2d6 points of damage. On each suc-
##cessful hit they may also sting for 2d4 points of

##
##For every 20 ants there will be a queen with an
##armor class of 3 and 10 HD. The queen is nor-
##mally a non-combatant. For each queen there will
##be 10-40 larvae which are normally overseen by
##the worker ants. Giant ants will never retreat if de-
##fending the queen.
##
##Giant ants tend to have little treasure but in some
##rare instances they inexplicably mine precious
##metals. This occurs in about 30% of nests, and
##there will be as much as 1d10x1000 gold pieces’

Giant vultures are scavengers. They search for car-
rion and prefer to avoid direct combat. They have
pink bald heads and greasy black feathers. As a
result of their diet, giant vultures are immune to
disease. They have a flying speed of 180’ (60’).
Giant vultures are often found with barrow harpies
who train them as pets or for protection. They at-
tack with sharp powerful beaks for 1d6+1 points of
damage.

Giant vultures draw strength from numbers. For
each giant vulture present after the third, their
morale increases by one (a morale of 8 with four
vultures, 9 with five vultures, etc) to a maximum
morale of 11. Barrow harpies also count toward
their numbers for improved morale. Giant vulture
hatchlings, or intact eggs, are worth 20-50gp

A flagstone golem is constructed from the stones
and mortar used to construct dungeon walls and
floors. These monsters often serve as special cam-
ouflaged guardians to protect crypts and other
important locations.

Flagstone golems are relatively flat and peel
themselves away from the wall or floor to surprise
tomb-robbers.

Bludgeoning weapons do full damage (all others
do half). Only spells that affect stone will cause
these golems full damage (acid, fire, cold, and
electricity cause half damage).

The size and damage inflicted by a flagstone go-
lem’s fists varies subject to HD. Examples in-
clude HD: 1-3 (1d6 each) and HD 4-6 (1d10 each),
etc.

Hoard Class: None

Gemstone golems are constructed by powerful
clerics and magic-users and are bound as tomb
guardians. They activate when certain conditions
or stipulations are met or broken (such as a living
creature entering the crypt they have been as-
signed to protect).

Gemstone golems appear as a huge hoard of
gemstones of all shapes, sizes, varieties, and cuts.
However, when disturbed, the gemstone golem
draws itself up quickly into a large, roughly hu-
manoid shape with great fists.

These golems attack twice per round with their
fists for 1d10 points of damage each; or, once
every three rounds, they can issue forth a hail of
gemstones from their body. This attack functions
similar to a breath weapon and does 8d4 points of
damage (save versus Breath Weapon for half) to
anyone caught in a cone 30’ long and 30’ wide
at its terminal end.

When defeated, PCs can collect 4d4+8 gem-
stones. Consult the random gem table (LL.107) to
determine their value.

A runic golem is roughly humanoid in shape and is
comprised of magical runic tablets found in
Barrowmaze. These golems are used to guard
tombs and crypts of import.

When a runic golem is first activated - normally by an intrusion into the
crypt it guards - its magical energy flickers on and off momentarily as if
powering up after a long period of dormancy.

The golem attacks by bashing opponents with its fists. When this golem is
struck opponents must save (Spells) or activate a random runic tablet (roll
1d6) with the following effect cast at 7th level (if applicable):
1. Burning Hands
2. Silence 15’ Radius
3. Cause Light Wounds
4. Hold Person
5. Glyph of Warding
6. Magic Missile

These golems are unaffected by non-magical weapons. Like all golems they have
no true intelligence, and hold, charm, or sleep spells are useless against
them. They are unaffected by poison or gases.

When a runic golem is destroyed, 1d4 runic tablets will remain intact.

Hoard Class: None

Sages believe that the icterine fungi is a distant
cousin of the violet fungi. Icterine fungi range from
3’ to 8’ tall and are often found growing among
shriekers and large mushrooms. The fungi’s strange
yellow color gives it a sickly appearance.

Similar to a violet fungi, the icterine fungi attacks
by flailing 1d4 tentacles at those within 5 feet. The
tentacles possess sharp, serrated edges that
cause 1d8 point of damage each.

With each successful hit, the victim must save (Poi-
son) or contract jaundice (incapacitated until
Cure Disease is cast).

Finally, on each successful hit, the fungi will inject
spores into its victim. This causes 1d10 small yellow
mushrooms to sprout aggressively from the wound.
Unless a Neutralize Poison spell is cast on the victim
immediately, each individual mushroom will ex-
plode in the next round causing 1d2 points of
damage each.

A lava weird appears as a large pseudopod that
emerges from a pool of lava. This appendage
looks like a snake at first glance but does not pos-
sess eyes or a mouth.

A lava weird attacks by bashing opponents with
its appendage for 1d8 points of damage. On a
successful hit, the lava weird has grabbed a PC
and will attempt to pull the victim back into its la-
va pool. A successful save (Paralyze) will break the
hold. Each round thereafter the held victim auto-
matically takes 1d8 points of damage of python-
like constricting damage plus 1d6 points of fire
damage. A lava weird will normally take 2 rounds
to pull an opponent into its lava pool.
Once immersed in the lava pool, victim is dead .

A lava weird is
immune to fire damage and takes double dam-
age from cold-based attacks.

##a giant skeletal dragon with small red orbs glowing dully in its eye sockets.
##Small vestiges of membrane may remain on its wings but most of its skin and
##tissue decayed long ago.
##
##A lich-dragon is a powerful monster and can at-

##is the same that it held in life. This attack can be
##used up to three times per day. The damage in-
##flicted is the same as its current hit points. Victims
##can save (Breath) for half damage.
##
##A lich-dragon can attack with a claw/claw/bite
##routine that does 1d8/1d8/2d10 points of dam-
##age. In addition, each successful attack does an
##additional 1d6 of cold damage.
##
##These undead monsters also possesses a gaze at-
##tack. If a character meets its glowing red orbs
##s/he must save (Paralyze) or be immobilized for 10
##rounds. A successful save will not require an addi-
##tional save during that encounter.
##
##Lich-dragons can also cast spells. The exact spells
##a lich-dragon possesses are subject to its dragon
##type and the discretion of the Referee. They cast
##at 10th level of magic use.
##
##They can Detect Invisibility, Clairaudience, and
##Animate Dead at will. A lich-dragon can only be
##harmed by +2 or better weapons and possesses a
##30% magic resistance.
##
##A lich-dragon is also immune to cold-based, elec-
##tricity, or death-related spells/attacks. Lich-
##dragons cannot be turned by a cleric and they
##radiate an aura of Fear (as per the magic-user
##spell of the same name).
##
##All creatures of 4 HD or under will immediately
##flee the sight of a lich-dragon with no saving
##throw, All others must save at -2 or suffer the same
##effect.
##
##A lich-dragon possesses the intelligence and the
##memories it had in life. They often speak Com-
##mon, Ancient Common, Dragon, and Black Tongue.
##
##They never sleep and thus, unlike living dragons,
##cannot be caught unaware. Like all undead, they

##In combat, the greater medusa prefers distance
##attacks such as its gaze (save versus Petrify or be

##(save or die). If forced into close melee, she will
##attack twice per round with any two of the follow-

##
##1) Fangs (1d8 plus poison, save or die).
##2) Shortsword (1d6).
##3) The snakes of a medusa’s hair can also attack
##(1d4 snakes) for 1d2 points of damage each (save
##versus poison or die).
##4) Tail Slam: 2d6 points of damage.
##The blood of a medusa is poisonous and, if har-
##vested and used within one week, will force a
##struck opponent to save (Poison) or die. The fol-
##lowing week, the blood will weaken considerably
##and only provide an additional 1d6 damage be-

##
##The head of a greater medusa can also be har-
##vested and used as a gaze attack for one week.
##However, each time the head is used in this fash-

##will bite the user (save versus Poison or die). There

A mummy lord appears in burial wraps like most
mummies. However, they often choose to wear
the symbols of their god in the form of religious
necklaces or headdresses that distinguished them
as high priests in life.

Mummy lords prefer to use their fists to club oppo-

In addition, those that are touched by a mummy
lord are immediately struck with blindness unless a

unaffected by mind-influencing spells.

They will always have a group of normal mummy
attendants and servants subject to their power

Necrolytes are magic-users devoted the cult of Nurgal who, by means of secret
rituals and enchantments, have become undying.

Despite their skin being pulled tightly over their
skeletons, necrolytes are not technically a type of
undead, at least not as the term is usually under-
stood. Clerics have no power over necrolytes and
thus cannot turn them.

Like true undead, though, necrolytes are immune
to mind-influencing spells. The cold touch of a
necrolyte deals 1d8 points of damage, and all of
these creatures can cast spells as if they were 7th-
level magic-users (3/2/2/1). Many are also
equipped with offensive magic items, such as
wands.

In return for the gift of immortality, necrolytes typi-
cally guard locations of particular importance to
the cult of Nurgal. They are often encountered
(75%) with 1d4+2 crypt knights to serve as their
personal escort.

While acting as crypt guardians, they are free to
continue their research into magic and occult
lore, unfettered by the weaknesses to which all
flesh is prone. Those who serve Nurgal faithfully
might one day gain access to more powerful ritu-
als that send them further down the path to
apotheosis.

Rot puddings are dungeon scavengers. They sub-
sist on carrion and thus are incubators for all forms
of disease. They are a sickly yellow-brownish color
and ooze pus from small orifices.
Rot puddings are immune to cold and electricity.

These puddings transmit their diseases in three
ways – and each requires a save (Poison). First, if a
pudding scores a hit its victim must save or be-
come infected. Second, if the pudding is hit by a
slashing weapon (sword, axe, etc), the wound will
squirt pus at the attacker, requiring a save. If a rot
pudding is burned by fire, the diseases it bears
become airborne in a noxious cloud (10x10 foot).
All those subject to the cloud must save or con-
tract disease.

Those who fail their save become infected and
are wracked by shooting pain and Slowed.
The victim’s body becomes
warm and perspires profusely. During the victims
next rest s/he will fall into a comatose state. The
victim must make a final save (Poison) or die with-
in 24 hours. If successful the s/he is reduced to 1 hit
point and incapacitated. A Cure Disease spell will
cure the infected character. Neutralize Poison
merely allows reroll of victim’s save.

A sandling appears as a simple pile of sand. How-
ever, they are semi-intelligent, territorial, and high-
ly solitary creatures.

They are easily provoked and attack by lashing
out with tendril-like appendages of sand.
If sandlings are exposed to a large quantity of wa-

Relics of an age long past, clockwork scorpions
are deadly magical constructs used to guard im-
portant tombs or precious treasures.

Clockwork scorpions strike quickly and are resilient
to damage due to their bronze carapace. Often
the first sign of their presence is the death cry of a
foolish tomb-robber. Unlike the clockwork cobra,
the clockwork scorpion is completely silent and
emits no noise when moving. The clockwork scor-
pion's stinger, located at the tip of its flexible tail,
contains a single dose of lethal venom. Anyone hit
by the stinger must save (Poison) or die. They
range from six inches to one foot in length.

Black skeletons, or black bones, are the skeletal
remains of mighty warriors infused with dark magic
to make them stronger than a standard skeleton.
Their bones glisten like black steel, and they bear
the armor (chainmail and shield), weapons
(longsword, hand axe, or mace), and equipment
they carried in life.

Small orbs of reddish light burn from their hollowed
eye sockets. When they attack, they emit a hellish
scream that causes Fear (as per the spell).
Necromancers of Set often use black skeletons as
their personal bodyguards. Like all undead, they
are unaffected by mind-influencing spells.

Exploding bone skeletons are an undead necro-
mantic construct.

Exploding bones look like regular skeletons, except
for a black inverted triangle painted on their fore-
head. They do not use weapons and have a
slower movement rate.

Upon reaching zero hit points, these skeletons ex-
plode showering anyone within 5 feet with bone
shards and causing 1d4 points of damage. Like all
undead, they are unaffected by mind-influencing
spells.

Fossil skeletons are often found in deep subterra-
nean passages where limestone or mineralized
water was in constant contact with bones.

Fossilized skeletons are effectively made of rock
and are harder to destroy than regular skeletons.
In some instances, the fossilization process has
been induced deliberately. Like all undead, they
are unaffected by mind-influencing spells.

At first glance, steel skeletons appears like a regu-
lar skeletons and are often mistaken as such.
Despite their outward appearance, they are not
undead but rather golem-like constructs made of
steel. Steel skeletons, therefore, cannot be turned.
They attack twice per round with their fists each
causing 1d8 points of damage. They can only be
damaged by magical weapons and are 50% im-
mune to magic.

Once a proud fighter of great ability, a skeleton
warrior appears as a skeleton draped in the tat-
tered clothes they possessed in life. They are fight-
ers of not less than 8th level of ability.

A skeletal warrior exists in an undead state be-
cause its soul was trapped in a golden circlet. The
circlet exerts power over the skeleton warrior, and
it is bound to obey the commands of its possessor.
A skeleton warrior will unerringly quest to regain its
circlet. Sages only speculate as to what happens
when a skeleton warrior obtains the circlet. Some
suggest the skeleton warrior simply crumbles and
dies; others suggest it will bring the warrior back to
life.

Their skeletal visage radiates an aura of fear. All
those with less than 4 HD must save (Spells) or
be affected by the magic-user spell Fear. A skele-
ton warrior cannot be turned. They are unaffect-
ed by mind-influencing spells.

Skeleton warriors cannot be destroyed. If reduced
to zero hit points they merely collapse into a bone
pile and will reconstitute themselves in 1d3 days.
A skeleton warrior retains the weapon it used in
life. These are often magical two-handed blades
of repute (with at least a +2 bonus). Their exact
detail is subject to the discretion of the Referee.

These spiders look similar to a giant black widow
spider, with one exception. Instead of a red hour-
glass design, a white patch - some say resembles
a skull - is located on the ventral abdomen.
These spiders do not have a poisonous bite, how-
ever they possess an insatiable hunger for hu-
manoid blood. When one blood-thirsty spider bites
into humanoid blood, all others immediately con-
verge on the wounded and will attempt to bite
(1d6) and then gorge themselves until the victim
has been drained (1d6 points of draining per
round). Their webs are inflammable.

These hideous, rotting undead creatures look like grisly cadavers infested
with wiggling Rot Grubs that squirm in and out of their decaying bodies.  They
attack with their fists for 2d4 points of damage. With each hit there is
a 10% chance that the victim will contract a flesh eating disease (every
2 months permanently lose 2 Constitution points until death at zero). This
disease can only be reversed magically via Cure Disease. The disease counter-
acts all other magical healing such as cure spells.  Moreover, with each hit
Rot Grubs may (50%) burrow into a struck character. If so, consult the entry
for Rot Grubs. If the Rot Grubs kill the character they will rise in 1d3 days
as a Son or Daughter of Gaxx.

These undead radiate a constant aura of fear 40’.  There is a 50% chance
fleeing PCs will drop whatever they are carrying.

Sons and Daughters of Gaxx regenerate 2 hit points per round even after being
reduced to zero hit points. They can only be destroyed by holy water, acid, or
fire. Sons and Daughters are treated as 5 HD monsters on the turning undead
table.

The spectral dead are the incorporeal spirits of
warriors interred in Barrowmaze long ago. They
have heard the call to rise that emanates from
The Tablet of Chaos, but their physical remains
have disintegrated to dust. With no bones to oc-
cupy, these vengeful spirits wander Barrowmaze
aimlessly, particularly in the areas close to The
Tablet. Their sole purpose is to destroy the living.
They possess 30% resistance to magic and can
only be hit by magical weapons. The appearance
of their weapons varies, but all do 1d8 point of
damage plus an additional 1d4 cold damage.
Like all undead, they are unaffected by mind-

The tomb-robbers found in Barrowmaze are usual-

make a few quick gold pieces by recovering
grave goods from the dungeon.

Half of these men are armed with clubs and slings.
They wear leather armor and carry shields. The
other half are armed with shortswords and light
crossbows. They wear chainmail and carry a
shield.

For every 10 tomb-robbers there will be a 2nd level
fighter who serves as their leader. The leader
bears a longsword, wears platemail, and carries a
shield. It is possible (10%) that one of these items is
magical (+1). Tomb-robbers possess hoard class
XXII in camp.

Funeral pyre zombies, sometimes referred to as
“Bombies” by veteran adventurers, are a strange
necromantic construct. They appear as normal
zombies except for black runes written on their
decaying flesh.

When hit for the first time, funeral pyre zombies will
burst into flames. However, they take no damage
from the fire. The intense heat burns off all flesh,
and the zombies will continue to attack as 2 hit
dice skeletons. These skeletons are immune to fire.
Anything located within 5 feet of a zombie when
lit will take 1d6 points of damage from the fire.
Note there is a 20% chance that this fire damage
will set off other funeral pyre zombies.
Like other undead, they are unaffected by mind-

Juju zombies are fearsome undead opponents.
They are distinguished from other zombies by their
dark amber-colored skin.

Juju zombies are stronger, faster, and possess
greater capacity for action than standard zom-
bies. They can use missile weapons and climb like
thieves of similar HD.

Like all undead, they are immune to mind influ-
encing spells. They are also immune to damage
from electricity, Magic Missile, and cold. They take
half damage from fire-based attacks.

A Juju zombie can only be struck with a +1 or bet-

Ravenous dead appear as regular zombies but
have an insatiable desire to feed on the living.
These undead abominations possess such an ap-
petite that, upon wounding a humanoid oppo-
nent, the remaining zombies will converge in a
pack to feed immediately on the victim.

If PCs engage in combat with previous wounds,
the ravenous dead will seek to target injured
characters first. Like all undead, they are unaf-
fected by mind-influencing spells.
