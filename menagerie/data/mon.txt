##Monstrosities — Introduction
##
##Introduction
##Monstrosities was created with the generous help of the Swords &
##Wizardry internet community, as you can see from the list of unusually
##brilliant authors whose erudition and eloquence grace these pages. The
##book’s successes are due to them, whilst any errors or failures in the
##transcription of their noble work are doubtless my own.
##
##Atk (ATTACK): This entry describes the number, type, and damage
##of a monster’s physical attacks. Sometimes monsters will have special
##attacks, such as a venomous bite, that are delivered with a physical attack.
##For this reason, some entries will show damage of (0) or (0 + special) or
##a similar notation.
##
##This reference book is a resource for the Swords & Wizardry Referee,
##containing a vast array of monsters for you to use in your campaign. Keep
##a few things in mind while reading this book. First of all, there aren’t any
##official rules that bind you as the Referee, so if you decide that a monster
##should have more hit dice, or that it should have better saving throws
##than the “official” version, make the change! In the same vein, if there is
##a monster that doesn’t really fit into your campaign, this book is only a
##sourcebook, so feel free to omit that monster entirely.
##
##Move: This entry gives the monster’s Swords & Wizardry movement
##rate.
##Save: This is the monster’s target number to make a saving throw of
##any kind.
##AL (ALIGNMENT): This entry contains a default alignment (Law,
##Neutrality, or Chaos) for the monster. In the first printing of this book we
##did not include alignments for the monsters, on the theory that they would
##feel like a limitation on the Referee’s ability to change and adapt the
##monsters to fit the individual campaign. The general reaction, however,
##is that a default alignment helps the Referee to get the feel of a monster
##and isn’t very constraining. So, feel free to change or adapt the default
##alignments!
##
##Reading the Entries and Conversion Notes
##The numerical information for each monster is shown as a “stat block”
##after the description of the monster, in the following format: HD; AC;
##Atk; Move; Save; AL; CL/XP; Special. Although the abbreviations will
##be second nature to most readers, they are described here.
##
##CL/XP (Challenge Level/XP): This is the difficulty level for killing
##the monster, and the number of experience points gained for killing the
##monster.
##
##HD (HIT DICE): The monster’s hit dice. To determine a monster’s hit
##points, roll a d8 once for each hit die, adding the results. If the entry reads
##something like “4+2,” this means you’d roll 4d8 and add 2 to determine
##the monster’s hit points. Bonus hit points are not added to each hit die.
##
##Special: A list of the monster’s special powers, with detail given in the
##text.
##
##AC (ARMOR CLASS): Each monster has two entries for armor
##class, one of which is in brackets. The first entry is for games using a
##“descending” armor class where lower is better. The bracketed number is
##for games where the Referee chooses to use an “ascending” armor class
##system where higher is better.
##
##Example Encounter: Following the main entry is a short scenario
##involving a sample encounter with the monster.

Aardvark, Giant
Hit Dice: 9
Armor Class: 5 [14]
Attacks: 1 tongue (swallow), 2 claws (1d8)
Saving Throw: 6
Special: Swallow whole
Move: 12
Alignment: Neutrality
Number Encountered: probably no more than one mated pair of adults, possibly with 1d4 younger ones (half hit dice).
Challenge Level/XP: 11/1,700
Giant aardvarks resemble their smaller cousins, with a long, pig-like
snout, rabbit-like ears, and a kangaroo-like tail. Instead of digging for
termites like the normal aardvark, giant aardvarks, which can measure as
large as twenty feet in length, tend to dig into cottages and subterranean
burrows for large prey such as humans, goblins, and ankhegs. The giant
aardvark’s tongue is ten feet long, and is used to suck prey into the aardvark’s mouth. A successful hit with the tongue forces the target to make a
saving throw or be yanked into the aardvark’s mouth and swallowed. The
monster can be attacked from within (at an AC of 9[10]) but only with a
short weapon such as a dagger. Anyone inside the aardvark’s stomach
takes 1d6 points of damage per round as he is digested. Giant aardvarks
don’t eat more than a couple of people before they lose interest.

Giant Aardvark: HD 9; AC 5[14]; Atk 1 tongue (swallows),
2 claws (1d8); Move 6; Save 6; CL/XP 11/1700;
Special: Swallow whole.

Mud Brothers and the Aardvark

A plume of smoke rises high into the sky. The plume is visible from
miles away. The smoke originates from a small, unnatural hill. Fist-sized
balls of metallic clay compose the massive 40-foot-tall mound of dirt.
Worn tracks wind along the sides and into numerous 4-foot-wide holes
that dot the hillside. Crude balls of golden clay lay beside an overturned
wheelbarrow at the foot of the path. Gertsy Borate and Custer Feldspar,
two dwarven miners, mine their precious gold clay from the short twisting
mine.

While Gertsy slaved away in the mine, a giant aardvark launched an
attack with its tongue into the holes. The giant aardvark lurks in the brush
nearby, biding its time and waiting for its prey to surface. Undiscovered by
the giant aardvark, Custer naps in a crude hammock beside the main trail.
He is oblivious to Gertsy’s predicament. Both dwarves are mud-caked
and not the brightest individuals. Gertsy is trapped within the shallow
mine. He is burning the pair’s supplies, hoping to scare off the aardvark
or at least signal Custer for help. The dwarves reward rescuers with a +2
ceramic shield that confers complete fire resistance. If an attacker rolls a
natural 20, however, the shield shatters into useless fragments.

Aaztar-Ghola
Hit Dice: 6
Armor Class: 3 [16]
Attacks: 2 swords (1d8)
Saving Throw: 11
Special: Spells, magic resistance 25%
Move: 12
Alignment: Chaos
Number Encountered: 1d4
Challenge Level/XP: 9/1,100
Aaztar-gholas are ancient creatures originating from some other
dimension, foul things that have established themselves in the prime
material plane. They are tall, and attire their hideous bodies in flowing,
richly embroidered robes, adorning themselves with strange, baroque
jewelry. Aaztar-gholas find human flesh delectable, especially when it
is cooked with the strange spices with which they flavor their food. An
aaztar-ghola lair often contains cauldrons, skewers, and several more
alien and disturbing culinary implements.
Aaztar-gholas have a particular necromantic affinity with ghouls, which
for some reason obey their commands without any perceptible reluctance.
The lair of an aaztar-ghola is likely (90% chance) to be guarded by a pack
of 2d6+6 of these undead. In the presence of an aaztar-ghola, ghouls are
highly resistant to being turned; treat them as vampires for this purpose.
Ghasts are also willing to serve aaztar-gholas, but they do so for their own
purposes; they are unaffected by the strange control that aaztar-gholas
have over ordinary ghouls. Aaztar-gholas themselves are not undead and
thus cannot be turned, although as creatures not inherently native to the
prime material plane they are affected by protection from evil.
These horrid creatures are natural adepts of the necromantic arts, and
all of them have spellcasting powers. Once per day, an aaztar-ghola can
cast the following spells: cause light wounds x2 (at a range of 50ft), fly,
detect invisibility, dispel magic, and finger of death. They are capable of
speaking with any sort of undead creature, even those such as zombies
that have no intellect at all. This ability to communicate with the undead
does not imply the ability to control; ghouls are the only undead creatures
that automatically follow commands given by an aaztar-ghola.

Pauper’s Inn

On the outskirts of the metropolis Bard’s Gate lies the Pauper’s Inn.
Nestled on the boundary of an expansive cemetery, the inn serves as a
temple and wayward mission. The large decrepit business provides
shelter for the homeless and offers free food and lodging if guests tend
the surrounding potter’s field. The inn serves delectable entrées and fine
mead beyond compare. Indeed, the abundant food tastes so delicious that
most of the residents tend to have portly frames and jolly spirits. The
inn operates under the guise of a temple to Atacharya, the goddess of the
downtrodden.
The truth is that the temple priest, Herbut Tisnyse is actually an aaztarghola under a powerful illusion to appear as a jovial friar. Eight ghouls, also
under the illusion, appear as buxom serving wenches who fulfill their clients’
every desire. Herbut, his wenches and even the patrons dress in the finest
robes and jewels (taken from those interned in the cemetery). Herbut slowly
fattens up patrons in order to cook and serve them as grand feasts for everyone
else. He claims the missing patrons simply moved on to a successful life.
The stories he weaves serve to instill hope in the remaining destitute patrons.
While staying at the Pauper’s Inn, patrons live a life full of feasts, elaborate
gifts, and delightful favors. The patrons defend their benefactors with their
life. Each patron wears 10d10 gp in jewelry and fine clothing. Herbut also
wears 10d10x10 gp in jewelry and a magic ring that can cast phantasmal
force once per day. The spells last for 23 hours. The ring can only mimic
the appearance of humans, although the exact details of the manifestation are
chosen by the wearer.

Monstrosities — Aardvark, Giant to Azer

Aboleth
Hit Dice: 9
Armor Class: 3 [16]
Attacks: 4 tentacles (1d6 + slime)
Saving Throw: 6
Special: Charm monster (3/day), Phantasmal force (3/day),
Mucus cloud in water (save or cannot breathe air for 3
hours), special disease upon successful hit (save or must be
immersed in water every hour).
Move: 9/12 (swimming)
Alignment: Chaos
Number Encountered: 1 (01-90%), 2 (91-98%), 2 +1d4 young
(99-00%)
Challenge Level/XP: 12/2,000
The aboleth is a revolting fish-like amphibian, primarily subterranean,
roughly the size of a killer whale. It vaguely resembles a catfish, but has
four long tentacles and four orifices along its belly. The tentacles can be
used to drag its bulk across dry land. These horrid abominations are extremely intelligent: an aboleth can cast charm monster three times per day,
and create a phantasmal force three times per day. In the water, an aboleth
surrounds itself with a cloud of mucus that requires anyone inhaling it to
make a saving throw or become unable to breathe air for 3 hours. Finally,
the slime on an aboleth’s tentacles causes disease if a saving throw fails.
Those afflicted suffer a change to their skin, which must be immersed in
water every hour, or the victim suffers 1d6 points of damage.
Aboleth: HD 9; AC 3[16]; Atk 4 tentacles (1d6 + slime); Move
9 (swim 12); Save 6; AL C; CL/XP 12/2000; Special: Charm
monster (3/day), phantasmal force (3/day), Mucus cloud
in water (save or cannot breathe air for 3 hours), special
disease upon successful hit (save or must be immersed in
water every hour).

Double Trouble, Aboleth in a Bubble

A rubbery blob of immense proportions bounds down the passage. The
viscous jelly-like globule is larger than a whale. Four tentacles extend from
the depths of the grotesque ball to pull it along. Five humanoid-shaped
figures swim within the opaque bubble near the permeable wall. A dark
foreboding shape looms within the bubble’s depths.
An aboleth lurks within the watery gel. The aboleth inside has the
ability to transform water into a semi-solid coagulation. The gelatinous
cloud of mucus acts as water surrounding the aboleth. Cold-based spells
slow the aboleth to quarter movement for 2d4 rounds. Electrical attacks
effect all within the bubble, and fire-based spells dealing over 25 points
of damage dissolve the mucus cloud. The mucus cloud and all those
within are immune to fire-based attacks that deal less than 25 points of
damage. Those within can see out of the bubble normally. Creatures with
aboleth-afflicted skin can pass through the mucus wall freely. Currently,
the aboleth has 5 bugbears under its control within the mucus cloud.
Bugbear: HD 3+1; AC 5[14]; Atk 1 bite (2d4) or weapon
(1d8+1); Move 9; Save 14; AL C; CL/XP 3/120; Special:
Surprise opponents, 50% chance.

Air Gust
Hit Dice: 3
Armor Class: 4 [15]
Attacks: 1 Wind blast (1d6+1 + Knockdown)
Saving Throw: 14
Special: -2 [+2] to AC vs. missile attacks.
Move: 12/18 (flying)
Alignment: Neutrality
Number Encountered: 1d8
Challenge Level/XP: 4/120
These minor elementals from the plane of Air resemble little
whirlwinds. Although no more than a few feet in height and width, these
tiny tornadoes can easily send the bulkiest adventurer flying in a range of
up to 15ft. The victim of a successful hit by an air gust has a 2 in 6 chance
of being knocked down (the referee may wish to modify the roll to take
into account exceptional strength).
The violent air gusts that make up this elemental’s form (and give it its
name) make missile/ranged attacks difficult and afford the elemental a
bonus of 2 to AC.
— Author: Skathros
Air Gust: HD 3; AC 4[15]; Atk Wind Blast (1d6+1 + Knockdown
- Range up to 15ft.); Move 12 (18 fly); Save 14; AL N; CL/XP

Raiders on the Storm

A wheel-less wagon made of bronze floats along the horizon. The craft
billows a dust cloud from its underside. A bronze cage holding 6 normal
human slaves dominates the wagon. Five uruaks slavers (scrap gnolls)
armed with nets and arquebuses (1d10 damage, backfire and be unusable
until repaired on an attack roll of 1) man the floating wagon. Four air
gusts carry the wagon at the command of a kzaddich. These marauding
slavers travel the planes in search of the comeliest of humans to sell in
otherworldly bazaars. The kzaddich stands atop the cage as the bronze
wagon circles its prey. It blows a dragon-shaped bronze trumpet that
expels an air gust that follows the command of the wielder. The trumpet
can only have 10 air gusts at anyone time. Furthermore, the trumpet may
implode (1 in 12 chance), releasing a very angry and large air elemental.
The air gusts gain their freedom once the trumpet implodes as the bronze
wagon crashes to the ground.
Uruak (Scrap Gnoll): HD 2; AC 5[14]; Atk 1 weapon (1d10);
Move 12; Save 16; AL C; CL/XP 2/30; Special: arquebus.
Kzaddich: HD 1+1; AC –8[27]; Atk 2 weapons (1d8); Move
12; Save 8; AL L; CL/XP 6/400; Special: Haste, improved
saving throws, immune to person-affecting spells, immune
to time spells, escape into future, mental powers, cannot be

Monstrosities — Aardvark, Giant to Azer

Allip
Hit Dice: 4
Armor Class: 5 [14]
Attacks: 1 strike (no damage, 1d4 points of wisdom lost)
Saving Throw: 13
Special: Drains wisdom, hypnosis
Move: 6 (flying)
Alignment: Chaos
Number Encountered: 1d4
Challenge Level/XP: 7/600
Allips are shadowy, incorporeal undead that mutter and speak with the
voice of madness from beyond the grave. The voice acts as a Suggestion
spell upon anyone hearing the quiet mutterings: the suggestions of an allip
are usually senseless but sinister. The allip’s touch does not deal damage,
but causes the victim to lose 1d4 points of wisdom. If a victim’s wisdom
falls to 0, it dies and will become an allip within 2d6 days. Allips can only
be hit with magical or silver weapons.
Allip: HD 4; AC 5[14]; Atk 1 strike (no damage, 1d4 points
of wisdom lost); Move (fly 6); Save 13; AL C; CL/XP 7/600;
Special: drains wisdom, hypnosis.

The Mutterings of an Old Man

Five recently slain, emaciated bodies lie strewn along a five-mile stretch
of road. The corpses are dressed in tattered clothing, and their shoes are
worn through. They each appear to have walked for days. The bodies,
each dressed in funeral attire, lie in grotesque poses. The first man’s body
appears to have died swallowing and choking on stones. The second
corpse of an elderly woman has numerous sticks and twigs inserted under
her skin. The next young man appears to have bled to death from hundreds
of thorns embedded in his nearly nude body. The forth woman suffocated
after burying her head in the dirt. The last victim was repeatedly run over
by a wagon. All but the fifth victim appear to have died from self-inflicted
wounds.
A small funeral procession rolls along the road one mile past the last
body. A man and woman walk behind an ornate funeral carriage. The
battered man repeatedly attempts cartwheels down the road despite
a dangling and broken arm. The ragged young woman frequently tries
to grab the rear wheels of the carriage. Her fingers and hands end in
bloody stumps. An old man dressed in black robes drives the carriage.
He alternatively whistles, mimics animal noises and jumbles words
incoherently. He seems oblivious to the proceedings going on behind him.
The dark and heavily shrouded horse-drawn hearse holds an ornate coffin
and the corpse of Felgard, a thief of some notoriety. The aged Felgard
retired a wealthy man with his family oblivious to his roguish lifestyle
and habitual thievery. Despite his easy lifestyle, Felgard still dabbled in
his profession by looting local crypts. A few days ago, he was slain by
an allip. During his funeral parade, Felgard transformed into an allip and
currently hides within the shrouded carriage. Its babbling and suggestion
abilities drove the mourners and driver mad and suicidal.

Amphoron of Yothri, Worker
Hit Dice: 2
Armor Class: 2 [17]
Attacks: 2 pincer-arms (1d6)
Saving Throw: 16
Special: Magic resistance 25%, immune to piercing weapons, chance of flickering, chance of electrical belch.
Move: 9
Alignment: Neutrality
Number Encountered:   1d4 workers or 1d4-1 workers, 1d3-1 warriors, and 1d2-1 juggernauts
Challenge Level/XP: 4/120
Amphorons of Yothri are mechanisms created by the Artificers of that plane
(see, “Artificers of Yothri”) using their strange magic-science. Amphorons on
the material plane are physical projections of a model that remains on Yothri
– the Artificer’s mind, possibly using a lens apparatus of some kind, projects
the device into the material plane, where it has a physical reality.

These projections can fail, and, moreover, the Artificer’s control of more
than one Amphoron at a time depends on his mental connection to a single,
controlling Amphoron. If the Artificer attempts to switch his mental
connection from one Amphoron to another, the process takes 1d6 rounds to
complete.

In any given round, any Amphoron has a 1 in 6 chance to “flicker,” due to
a momentary interruption of the connection across time and space.  While
flickering, the Amphoron cannot be attacked, and cannot inflict damage.
However, it regains 1 hit point when it rematerializes. A flickering Amphoron
is visible as a faint, static-shrouded shape. In the following round, the
Amphoron reappears (unless it fails a second roll of the d6).

The controlling Amphoron has only a 1 in 20 chance of flickering, but if it
does so, all of the Amphorons under its control will flicker. Any Amphoron can
be used as the controller, but a single controller cannot control more than
six other Amphorons, and an Artificer can only project his mind to one
controller at a time. Thus, unless the Artificer has projected some apparatus
(the possibilities are many, and left to the Referee’s creativity) to allow
remote controllers or auto-controls, the maximum number of Amphorons
encountered at time is seven (six controlled and one controller). When the
Artificer’s nefarious schemes on the material plane are complete, he will
likely not bother to disintegrate his Amphorons, so their material substance
will remain on the material plane, operating randomly, remaining completely
inert, or proceeding independently with their rudimentary intelligence.

All Amphorons have a metallic, jointed shell; their insides are filled with
wires and a gel-like flesh which allows the mental connection with the distant
reality of Yothri, and also gives the creature its basic intelligence. There
are three varieties of Amphoron, although the Referee could design others with
little effort.

Worker Amphorons are just smaller than a human, and move with crablike legs
(although they can levitate for up to 3 rounds once per day, if need be). As
with other Amphorons, they have a 1 in 6 chance of flickering unless used as
a controller by the Artificer. In addition to the chance of flickering,
a worker Amphoron may randomly belch out arcs of electricity, inflicting 1hp
damage to anyone within 10ft (in addition to its other actions).

Worker Amphoron: HD 2; AC 2[17]; Atk 2 pincer-arms
(1d6); Move 9; Save 16; AL N; CL/XP 4/120; Special: magic
resistance 25%, immune to piercing weapons, chance of
flickering, chance of electrical belch.

Worker Amphoron — Stairs of Glass

Along the shore stands an impossibly tall spiral staircase. Designed
for a creature of gigantic proportions, the staircase reaches a towering
400-foot-tall peak where it abruptly ends. Made of thick, translucent glass
embedded with streaks of polished metal, the stair’s purpose remains a
mystery. Each of the 10-foot-wide steps stands 5 feet tall. The steps spiral
around a central column made of a denser opaque black glass.
For the past 50 years, 6 worker amphorons have worked tirelessly
building the staircase. Two of the automatons remain at the top of the
tower, painstakingly building the stairs ever upward. The amphorons
work around the clock, using their electric arcs to heat, mold and shape
the glass and framework. At night, their eclectic sparks are visible for
miles. The other amphorons scour the sands and nearby water for pure
white silica and veins of metal to use in the spiral stair’s creation. The
stairs act as a lightning rod, and the entire staircase glows white hot for
hours after lightning strikes during severe weather. The amphorons focus
their electrical attack on the veins of metal. All living creatures in contact
with the stairs suffer the effects of the electrical attack.


Amphoron of Yothri, Warrior
Hit Dice: 5
Armor Class: 2 [17]
Attacks: 2 pincer-arms (1d6+2)
Saving Throw: 12
Special: Magic resistance 25%, immune to piercing weapons, chance of flickering, flamethrower.

Warrior Amphorons are usually used to protect Worker Amphorons, or
in situations where the Artificer’s schemes involve violence. They have
a flamethrower which is in constant operation, allowing the Amphoron to

Warrior Amphoron — Telluric Turret

Twin, 50-foot-tall towers guard a deeply rutted road leading up a barren
mountain. From each, a gleaming metallic turret spews a constant stream
of liquid flame in a never-ending circle. All vegetation within a mile of
the mountain has been burnt to near ash. Bizarre, insect-like footprints
cover the crisp ground in a multitude of crisscrossing paths. Two warrior
amphorons guard the road up the mountainside to an enormous castle
perched on the peak. Although the walls of the towers are as smooth
as glass, the large grey bricks swirl as if made of smoke. Upon closer
inspection, agonized face can be seen swirling within each block. The
blocks resist all form of damage and radiate a harmless feeling of cold
and sorrow.

Seven roads lead to the peak of this sole mountain among the plains.
Twin towers secure each road. A 30-foot-tall brick wall spans the distance
between the towers. At any time, 2d4 worker amphorons steadily build
the walls using more of the gray, misty bricks. In addition there is a 2 in 6
chance that 2d6 worker amphorons carrying living humans and animals
in their claws travel through the gate toward the mountain. The warrior
amphorons climb down the towers to attack if the workers are slain.


Amphoron of Yothri, Juggernaut
Hit Dice: 10
Armor Class: 2 [17]
Attacks: 2 whirling blades (2d6+2) or crane (special)
Saving Throw: 5
Special: Magic resistance 25%, crane, chance of flickering.
Move: 9
Alignment: Neutrality
Number Encountered:   1d4 workers or 1d4-1 workers, 1d3-1 warriors, and 1d2-1 juggernauts
Challenge Level/XP: 13/2,300
Amphorons of Yothri are mechanisms created by the Artificers of that plane
(see, “Artificers of Yothri”) using their strange magic-science. Amphorons on
the material plane are physical projections of a model that remains on Yothri
– the Artificer’s mind, possibly using a lens apparatus of some kind, projects
the device into the material plane, where it has a physical reality.

These projections can fail, and, moreover, the Artificer’s control of more
than one Amphoron at a time depends on his mental connection to a single,
controlling Amphoron. If the Artificer attempts to switch his mental
connection from one Amphoron to another, the process takes 1d6 rounds to
complete.

In any given round, any Amphoron has a 1 in 6 chance to “flicker,” due to
a momentary interruption of the connection across time and space.  While
flickering, the Amphoron cannot be attacked, and cannot inflict damage.
However, it regains 1 hit point when it rematerializes. A flickering Amphoron
is visible as a faint, static-shrouded shape. In the following round, the
Amphoron reappears (unless it fails a second roll of the d6).

The controlling Amphoron has only a 1 in 20 chance of flickering, but if it
does so, all of the Amphorons under its control will flicker. Any Amphoron can
be used as the controller, but a single controller cannot control more than
six other Amphorons, and an Artificer can only project his mind to one
controller at a time. Thus, unless the Artificer has projected some apparatus
(the possibilities are many, and left to the Referee’s creativity) to allow
remote controllers or auto-controls, the maximum number of Amphorons
encountered at time is seven (six controlled and one controller). When the
Artificer’s nefarious schemes on the material plane are complete, he will
likely not bother to disintegrate his Amphorons, so their material substance
will remain on the material plane, operating randomly, remaining completely
inert, or proceeding independently with their rudimentary intelligence.

All Amphorons have a metallic, jointed shell; their insides are filled with
wires and a gel-like flesh which allows the mental connection with the distant
reality of Yothri, and also gives the creature its basic intelligence. There
are three varieties of Amphoron, although the Referee could design others with
little effort.

The Juggernaut Amphoron is a harvester/processor the size of a semiattached
trailer truck, with a moving crane mounted on its back and two huge circular
saws mounted on its articulated arms. If the Juggernaut’s crane hits an
opponent, the victim is lifted up into the air over the Juggernaut’s
processing hatch, and dropped automatically in the following round. If the
crane hits, a saving throw is permitted to escape the its grasp unless the
target is wearing metal armor, in which case no saving throw is allowed (the
crane contains a backup magnet). Anyone dropped into the processing hatch is
processed within 1d4 rounds into a small brick.

Juggernaut Amphoron — Telluric Fortress

Atop a mountain peak surrounded by telluric turrets (see warrior amphorons)
stands the foundation of a massive fortress. The fortress covers the entire
mountain peak and is in the early stages of construction.  Judging by the size
of the stairs and entry arches, the castle appears made for giant-sized
creatures. Normally, 5d6 worker amphorons work around the clock building the
fortress from mysterious gray bricks. In addition there is a 2 in 6 chance
that 2d6 worker amphorons carrying living humans and animals in their claws
navigate the maze-like foundation toward the fortress’s center. Made from
impenetrable opaque glass, the bricks appear to trap tormented souls. Peering
into the bricks reveals faces of humanoids and animals screaming in silent
anguish. Any intrusion into the construction site immediately draws the
attention of 3d6 warrior amphorons. At the heart of the castle stands an
amphoron juggernaut in what appears to be a throne room of immense
proportions. The amphoron juggernaut grasps a human in its crane. It examines
the pleading creature before dropping it into its hatch to be processed into
a brick. The bricks are then used to build the fortress. Around the
juggernaut, 2d6 worker amphorons hold other living creatures waiting their
turn with the juggernaut. Four warrior amphorons always accompany the amphoron
juggernaut as it processes the hapless creatures. The dreadful castle’s
purpose remains a mystery beyond mortal ken.

Special: Entangle
Move:6
Alignment: Neutrality
Number Encountered: varies
Challenge Level/XP: 1/15
Animated objects generally do not have minds of their own, being animated
by a spell rather than by a spirit of some kind. They may follow programmed
instructions, or might follow the orders of a master if the master is actually
present. Since there are so many possible types of objects, and so many different
ways in which an object might be animated, the exact details of the object are
left to the Referee. Two examples are provided, although even with animated
chairs and tables the exact details can (and should) occasionally differ.

This version of an animated carpet attacks for no damage, but if the
target is hit and fails a saving throw, the carpet holds the character,
struggling, until a saving throw is successful.

Patchwork Carpet
Thick, 10-foot-square area rugs cover the entire floor of this 40-foot-wide hall.
The hall stretches 100 foot to a center door set against the far wall. Thousands
of broken glass beakers and ceramic flasks litter the carpet. Randomly scattered
among the normal rugs are 10 animated carpets, each covering a 10-foot-deep
pit. The animated carpets remain stiff and ridged (supporting PCs’ weight) until
tread upon. The animated carpet then envelops the creature and falls into the pit.
A saving throw negates the initial engulfing attack, but the PC must then make
a second saving throw to avoid falling into the pit. Each pit is half filled with
sludge-like oil. Engulfed creatures that fall into the pit are covered in the viscous
oil and run the risk of drowning. Furthermore, the glass and ceramic shards inflict
1 point of damage each round as the animated carpet tightly squeezes the victim
and grinds the shards into the PCs’ flesh. Opening the door on the far wall causes
a shower of sparks to fall from channels in the ceiling. The sparks ignite the oil (on
creatures and in pits). The oil pits burn for 1d6 hours or until extinguished. Dense,
choking smoke fills the hall and surrounding corridors. PCs covered in oil take
2d6 points of damage for 2d4 rounds or until they wash the oil away.

Festoon Feast of Fervor

A grand banquet hall worthy of nobility stands ready for all. A massive
curving table with thirteen table settings sits warm and inviting. Carved in
the likeness of two giant crocodiles, the wooden table presents a feast of
roast swine, leek and mushroom soup, and honey mead. Each of the large
chairs is carved to represent a hoofed animal such as cows, deer, mules and
elk. The center throne resembles two gazelles joined at the hindquarters.
A massive fireplace sits opposite the curving table, and is ablaze with a
warm fire. A bearded gnome sits on the center throne at the table’s apex. He
jovially welcomes visitors into his chamber, stating he is “a good-natured
gnome” on a life quest to bring relief to the weary. He goes by the name
Amikal the Cheery. Amikal, actually a doppelganger, has made it his
mission to rid the world of hostile, senseless adventurers. Amikal’s feast
(which he painstakingly prepares with specialty brewed elixirs every night)
heals 1d6 hit points and grants a bless spell that lasts for 1d6 hours (roll
individually). Although he asks for nothing in return for the meal and rest,
he expects some token of thanks.

Amikal has a nasty surprise for impolite or impulsive guests. While the
table is harmless, the 13 animated chairs surrounding it are not. Each chair
follows Amikal’s commands and has straps to secure victims (saving throw
to avoid). Amikal commands the chairs to either leap into the fireplace or
smash into one another. The gazelle throne has double the movement of
normal animated chairs. Amikal uses his throne to escape if the encounter
turns against him. Amikal carries a special magical wand that only animates
chairs. The wand has 21 charges remaining.

Acid Reflex

At the edge of the forest, a bewildered halfling stands before
the scraggly hills. A large, overburdened wagon sits nearby. Odd
contraptions and unidentifiable junk lie strewn around it. Ollie
Nematoad, an ill-fated inventor, needs help. Ollie wants to harvest
acid from a colony of ankhegs lairing in the eroded and dusty hills
beyond the forest. Ollie wants the acid from the ankhegs to further
research experiments involving acid-resistant suits. Simply killing
the beast to harvest the acid may contaminate the samples, however.
For this reason, he needs only acid that has been excreted by their
acid attack. Ollie has several of his prototype acid resistant suits
(made from rubbery and slightly putrid otyugh intestines). He has
three human or elf suits, one dwarf and two small (halfling or gnome)
sized suits. These cannot be worn over armor. Unfortunately, the suits
offer no protection whatsoever, including against acid attacks. Ollie
absentmindedly neglects to inform volunteers of this fact; after all
he is trying to improve his existing designs and needs to test their
resistance qualities. None of the previous employees have returned
with acid samples (Ollie also conveniently forgets this). The colony
consists of 5d6 ankhegs of various sizes, although only 1d4+1 will
investigate creatures moving into their territory.

Ollie needs a few vats of acid. He currently has 5 large glass vats
with cork lids that PCs can use to catch the acid. To do so, PCs must
willingly be hit by an acid attack. While facing the acid attack, the PC can
counterattack. If the PC’s attack roll is higher than the ankheg’s, the PC
manages to catch enough acid to fill the vat. The acid attack still does half
damage to the PC as the acid covers him. The PC takes full damage if his
attack is lower than the ankheg’s.

Ollie offers 100 gp per filled vat and promises a suit of his perfected,
acid-proof suit when it is completed in 2d4 months. Within the ankheg’s
warrens lie the shredded and partially dissolved former employees Ollie
sent into the colony. The corpses have 3d10 gp and wear partially liquefied
suits made of oiled fish skins. Among the broken glass vats lay 2 potions
of healing and a +2 trident.

The Shrine of Adar Dralg

Thick vines cover this once magnificent settlement. Ruins and vague
foundations are all that remain of the once-thriving civilization. A massive
120-foot-high dome rises above the tropical forest floor. Although the
columns that once supported the dome have fallen, the dome remains
stable and hovers above the jungle floor. Ancient vines entwine the dome
as if trying to pull it back to the earth. The vines twirl in massive pillars
up to the dome and curtains of lush vegetation cascade down, shrouding
the interior from view.
A pedestal under the dome’s center holds a multifaceted cluster of
lavender crystals. The translucent rock glows slightly under the dome’s
shadow. Mosaics on the dome depict masculine beasts and apes enslaving
more civilized races. Once revered by humans, the deity Adar Dralg
represented physical supremacy over the weak. Long ago, humans
abandoned his callous doctrine of physical dominance. In his anger,
he destroyed their city and filled it with his loyal and chaotic minions.
Through years of war and plunder, only a few of his lineage remain to
guard the shrine and its treasured centerpiece. Among other dangers that
wait in the city, 4 winged apes of unusual intelligence guard the Crystal of
Adar Dralg. The apes lounge atop the floating dome. Each is armed with
a crude heavy spear and salvaged stone blocks.
The Crystal of Adar Dralg imbues the possessor with incredible
strength. Unfortunately, the crystal also slowly transforms the possessor
over 3d6 days into an ape. Those with more than 6 hit dice turn into a
winged ape in service of Adar Dralg.

Palanquin of the Ape King

Deep in the southern jungles lies a treetop kingdom of apes led by a
creature that is half man and half ape. Although the apes have rudimentary
intelligence, they are a formidable community under the guidance and
powers of the Ape King. The apes raid local villages for food and slaves
(which are often used in gladiator style battles). The apes are brutal and
uncaring, but not chaotic. The ape king is known to have a harem of
female apes and captured humans.
The Ape King travels the area leading 8 gorillas. The gorillas carry
the Ape King on a stone palanquin. These ape guards carry heavy spears
made of solid iron. These weighty spears require great strength to wield
and deal 1d10 points of damage. The apes throw the spears and use their
fists in combat.
The Ape King can levitate, create a 10–ft. radius circle of magical

A Bridge Too Far

The passage opens into a long wide cavern where a shallow lake covers
the floor. The crystal-clear water teems with subterranean life. Calcium
dams and natural bridges create traversable paths. Shield-sized oysters
sit open along the bottom of the lake, some displaying large pearls. The
lake averages five feet deep and its inhabitants are harmless. Semiprecious
crystals cover the floors and walls, sparkling from the brilliant luminosity
given off by fungi growing along the ceiling. Large spherical mushrooms
glow a soft hue and bathe the room in emerald light. Tendrils and spiraling
roots dangle from the glowing pods like a radiant jungle reaching for
the water below. Near the center of the chamber sits a female statue of
a forgotten deity of elvish origin. The statue holds a short sword in one
hand and an orb in the other. A crystalline coating of gypsum coats the
statue like frost on a cold autumn morning. Among the hanging fungus
are 6 aqueous orbs that feed on the blind fish in the lake. The white
stone glaze conceals the true nature of the dark elf statue. The innately
evil statute holds a translucent crystal ball with a direct connection to a
dark elf priestess. Furthermore, the dark elf priestess can see, hear and
cast spells through the crystal ball. Covering or destroying the crystal ball
breaks the connection.

An aranea is an intelligent, shapechanging spider with sorcerous powers. In its natural form, an aranea resembles a big spider, with a humpbacked body a little bigger than a human torso. It has fanged mandibles

the mandibles. Each arm has a hand with four many-jointed fingers and a
double-jointed thumb. An aranea weighs about 150 pounds. A hump on its
back houses its brain.
Aranea can cast webs at a single opponent at a range up to 40ft (saving
throw). The victim is entangled, but can break free within 1d6 rounds.
These horrid creatures are spellcasters, able to cast one second level and
two first level magic-user spells. Usually, an aranea is prepared with 2
charm person spells and a mirror image spell; or, alternatively, with 1
charm person, 1 sleep spell, and invisibility.

What a Tangled Web She Weaves

Webs cover the ground and surrounding fauna. Millions of normal
spiders swarm over the terrain and webs as they flee approaching
intruders. The desiccated corpse of a riding horse lies partially cocooned
on the path ahead. The once fine horse bears the standard of local nobility.
Upon closer inspection, the mummified horse appears to have died months
ago. The weakened screams of a human woman carries on the wind from
farther down the wooded path. As the webs thicken, the spiders increase
in size. Ahead lies a horizontally angled, solid web. The opaque web holds
a cocooned human woman. Blood stains the web around her pale body,
and she weakly struggles against the strands holding her. A giant spider
(4–ft. diameter) drops down from the webbed canopy to attack intruders.
The woman is an aranea disguised to lure victims into her trap. An
additional 2 giant spiders (6–ft. diameter) hide under the thick white
web, ready to defend the aranea once she begins her spell assault. She has
a special wand of web (18 charges) that carries an electric charge. Those
caught in the web suffer 1 point of electrical damage each round until freed.
The webs from the wand last 3d6 rounds until it dissipates.

##Arcanixes (also known as Spell-Stealers), resemble tall, gaunt humans
##with bluish skin and pointed ears. They are extraplanar creatures that foray
##into the mortal realms in their obsessive search for magic. They prize
##magical items above all else, but spellbooks and arcane lore (as well as
##spellcasters themselves) are also sought to take back to their home plane.
##There are three types of Arcanix: Arcanix Minor (3HD), Arcanix Major
##(6HD) and Arcanix Greater (12HD). If an arcanix is encountered bearing
##a weapon, it is a near certainty that the weapon is magical in nature (the
##referee should base the weapon in accordance with the type of arcanix).
##An arcanix that can successfully touch a spell-caster may steal spell
##levels up to its own number of hit dice. Example: An Arcanix Minor
##(3HD) may steal a third level spell from a magic-user, or three 1st level
##spells, or a 2nd and a 1st level spell. The spell-caster is allowed a saving
##throw to negate this effect. If the attack is successful (and the save fails)
##the stolen spells leave the magic-user’s memory (until he can re-memorize
##them again), and the arcanix may use them as if he had memorized them.
##The number of times per day that an Arcanix may use this ability depends
##on the type of Arcanix; Minor 1/day, Major 3/day, Greater 6/day.
##Arcanixes possess the following spell-like Abilities: Detect Magic 3/day,
##Read Magic 3/day, Dispel Magic 2/day, Dimension Door 1/day. An arcanix
##may teleport to or from its home plane once (3HD), twice (6HD), or 3 times
##(12HD) per week.

##Hollow Man
##
##A large armored ogre stands guard outside this sturdy oaken door. Upon closer
##inspection, the ogre is just a hollowed out corpse. Its fused armor holds the ogre
##corpse upright. An unknown fire burned from within the ogre, leaving only an
##empty cavity. Feeble shrieks in the Common tongue can be heard coming from
##behind the door. The male voice pleads for his life’s work between sobs. Behind
##the locked door lies the wizard Mellum. He is pleading and in obvious mental
##distress. Mellum spent his entire adult life (98 years) dedicated to recording and
##accumulating the history of magecraft into massive tomes that fill his library.
##While a few of the books have magical properties, the vast majority are simply
##mundane historical references works. The library stands mostly empty. Floating
##loose leaf papers, dust and debris haphazardly levitate throughout the room. The
##room has several large wings containing rows of empty bookshelves. Standing
##above the crumpled old man is an arcanix. Books float from the shelves into a
##
##swirling dimensional portal next to the arcanix. The arcanix ignores the pleas of
##the helpless (and spell-less) wizard as he steals Mellum’s life work.
##After years of searching and surveillance, the arcanix arrived at Mellum’s
##library to pilfer the knowledge and even Mellum himself. The arcanix has
##already transported the vast library to its home plane and now plans to
##kidnap the hapless Mellum as well. The portal is tied to the arcanix and
##dissipates with his defeat. Currently, the arcanix has stolen shield and
##mirror image from Mellum’s spell repertoire. (Add more spells for major
##and greater arcanix as needed.) If rescued, Mellum responds with despair at
##the irrevocable loss of his life’s work. With nothing left, Mellum decides it
##is time to get on with his life. He immediately sets off to find a suitable bride
##(starting with any female PCs) to start a family.

Big Prick

The booming logging settlement of Krieger’s Pointe has grown since
the end of the recent pestilence that plagued the inhabitants. The loggers
harvest the timber in the high mountains and send the wood down miles
of log flumes to the town of Carson’s Mill. Kudan Stoenawl, the owner
of Stoenawl Timber has recently experienced some major setbacks. It
seems that someone has again vandalized the log flumes a few miles
down the mountain. The vandalism makes the flumes inoperable. After an
investigation, he sent a repair team to rebuild the flume. Not surprisingly,
they did not return. His scouts report the workers were crucified and no
other clues were found. Kudan needs mercenaries to escort his laborers
down the flume to repair the damage. Kudan offers a seaworthy barge that
he needs to unload. The outdated ship (named Log Jammer) is the size
of a small galleon (no weapons). It has outlived its purpose in the timber
company and Kudan needs to get rid of the well-used vessel.
An archer tree recently moved into the area and destroyed part of
the flumes in hopes of scaring the loggers away. Once that failed, the
archer tree killed the three loggers who arrived to repair the flume. The
archer tree impaled the corpses on spear-like pine needles jammed into the
ground to serve as a warning. The archer tree currently stands motionless
adjacent to the three crucified loggers. While it does not attack scouts,
anyone attempting to repair the flume invokes its wrath.

Artificers of Yothri
Hit Dice: 10
Armor Class: 2 [17]
Attacks: 1 claw (1d10+1)
Saving Throw: 5
Special: Magic resistance 50% (80%), psychic powers, magic
powers.
Move: 15
Alignment: Chaos
Number Encountered: 1
Challenge Level/XP: 14/2,600
The artificers of Yothri are tall and skeletal, a construction of dark-hued
metalloid bones acting as the framework for artificial tubes and organs.
They wear hoods and long, black robes – perhaps a necessity of the dead
world they inhabit in a distant and eroding reality. Their palaces are of
baroque green glass and alien metals, twisting in unnatural shapes, domes,
and bubbles. The artificers are mutually hostile, each coveting the others’
resources and knowledge. It is remotely possible that player characters
might be kidnapped to serve an artificer by attacking the citadel of one of
the others in the barren, suppurating wastelands of Yothri itself.
An artificer employs the Science of Yothri, which is a mix of psychic
powers, magic, and technology impossible to achieve outside the physical
realities of Yothri itself. Rather than manifesting in spells, the Science
of Yothri allows the Artificer to use certain powers, some mental, some
magical, as follows:
Psychic powers: at will, (in conjunction with a physical attack if
desired), the artificer can use telekinesis to lift up to 300 pounds of weight,
create or maintain a “double vision” effect similar to a single mirror
image per the spell, increase magic resistance to 80%, maintain a mental
connection with an amphoron in another plane, or work to establish a
connection with an amphoron in another plane (the mental connection
with amphorons is described below).
Magical powers: in conjunction with a psychic power (but not with
physical attacks), the Artificer may create one of the following effects
using the Science of Yothri: (1) once per day, the Artificer can cast charm
person in a cone shape 60ft long and reaching 60ft wide at extreme
range, (2) three times per day, the Artificer can cast a spell to cause metal
poisoning in the target’s bloodstream (a saving throw applies), rendering
the victim helpless with pain and causing death within 2d6 rounds unless
the poison is counteracted.

Plague of Erosion

The large town of Alement sits nestled among rolling hills barely under
the shadow of the Hollow Spire Mountains. Just over six days ago, a
sudden and deafening explosion was heard from the southern woodlands.
Scouts reported that a strange blight now covers the area with a rust-like
disease. They claim that the plague kills all animals and plant life that it
touches.

Indeed, a horrid plague has spread from a massive 10-foot cube of iron
lying partially buried in an impact crater. This solid cube radiates a plague
that turns all living creatures into rusting iron (saving throw negates). A
successful save indicates permanent resistance to the plague regardless of
the amount of exposure. The outer cells of living creatures that fail a saving
throw begin to rust (just like oxidized iron) and fall to the ground in a fine
dust. Creatures affected by the plague remain alive for 1 day for each hit
dice they possess (a 4 HD black bear lives for 4 days before oxidizing into a
heap of rust). The plague expands in a 10-foot radius every day, emanating
from the cube. Currently, the plague has turned everything within a 60-foot-
radius to rust-like dust.

An Artificer of Yothri is behind the destructive force. The artificer
brought the alien plague cube to spread ruin and devastation. She currently
hides within the cube, phasing out to greet interlopers. The artificer can
freely enter and exit the cube as if it were thin air, although she can not see
out of it. The cube is solid iron to all but artificers of Yothri.

Although the rusting plague ravages every living creature and plant,
it can be cured by magical means (such as cure disease) or a simple
covering of oil. Any application of crude oil (or its derivatives) kills the
rusting plague on contact. Furthermore, an oil coating over the iron cube
stops the plague at its source by turning the cube into nothing more than
a solid block of metal (killing the artificer of Yothri if she remains within
the cube).

Assassin Vine
Hit Dice: 7

Saving Throw: 9

The assassin vine is a semi-mobile plant that collects its own grisly
fertilizer by grabbing and crushing animals and depositing the carcasses
near its roots. A mature plant consists of a main vine, about 20 feet long.
Smaller vines, up to 5 feet long, branch off from the main vine about every
6 inches.
An assassin vine can move about, albeit very slowly, but usually stays
put unless it needs to seek prey in a new vicinity.
An assassin vine growing underground usually generates enough offal
to support a thriving colony of mushrooms and other fungi, which spring
up around the plant and help conceal it.
An assassin vine can animate plants in the near vicinity (about 30ft),
and these plants will immobilize anyone failing a saving throw.

Hang in There

An old tower rises from the forest ahead. A crumbled rock wall surrounds
the tower’s base. Thick vegetation has reclaimed the once manicured
grounds. Clinging vines coat the towers, camouflaging the walls. Upon
closer inspection, arrow slits can be seen behind the deep foliage covering
the tower. The tower does not appear to have any openings on the ground
level, but a single large window breaks through the rounded walls near
its 40–foot peak. A withered corpse of a maiden hangs partially out the
window. Her tattered clothing and desiccated skin attest to her death some
months ago. Long golden hair still attached to her skull hangs down from
the window and blows in the wind. The thick vines around the tower are
harmless and easily climbable.
Just below the window 30 feet from the ground grows an assassin vine.
The vine actually grows on the inside of the tower but has branched out
through a narrow arrow slit. The tower is mostly hollow and the only
entrance lies bricked over behind the vines. The wooden floor on the
lowest level rotted away long ago. Thick plants and vines (including the
assassin vine) now flourish within the moist soil inside the tower. The
tower’s roof has mostly caved in, allowing sunlight to filter into the
structure. The upper (and only remaining level) lies in a state of ruin.
Most of the wooden floor and stairs deteriorated to an unstable condition.
The wooden floor and stairs can support some weight if carefully tread
upon. The assassin vine killed the maiden (once a thief). The vine, either
by chance or via some rudimentary intelligence, uses the corpse to attract
prey. Its vines grow through the corpse and hold it up near the window.
The vines move the corpse like a puppet if it desires. The corpse holds a
rope and grappling hook and has a belt pouch containing a sapphire (250
gp), thieves’ tools and wears a silver chastity belt (100 gp).

Astral Moth
Hit Dice: 4+2
Armor Class: 4 [15]
Attacks: 1 bite (1d6)

Special: Dimensional flight

Alignment: Any (see below)
Number Encountered: 1
Challenge Level/XP: 5/240
Astral moths are large, moth-like creatures with the bizarre ability to
carry other creatures between planes of existence, or into other dimensions.
The origins of these rare creatures are lost in the sands of time, but three
varieties are now known. The dark and the white varieties are both semiintelligent, the dark-colored moths being Chaotic in alignment and the
white ones being aligned with Law. There is also a grey variety which
is apparently closer to the original breeding stock, having only animal
intelligence and a Neutral alignment. All three varieties are capable of
planar travel, taking their instructions by means of a rudimentary mental
telepathy. Poorly trained and untrained astral moths may attempt to throw
off a rider mid-journey, which is a significant hazard.
Once an astral moth is airborne, it can begin flying into the spaces
between realities on the way to other planes of existence or other
dimensions. The time required for such travel will vary in accordance
with the intended destination.
The creatures themselves are relatively harmless; the threat of an astral
moth is whatever strange being might be riding it as a mount. Astral
moths have been used by many ancient, non-human civilizations existing
in different times, planes, or dimensions. They are, of course, greatly
prized by wizards, and the egg of an astral moth is worth 5,000 gp if sold.
Capturing a wild adult is possible, but care must be taken in order to keep
it from getting airborne: if the creature is able to take wing, it will escape
into the unknown dimensions.

Lunar Moth

A wounded melgara lies in a glade, a rusted blade protruding from
her chest. Strange blood stains her clothes and the ground around her.
The poisoned blade infected her blood, leaving her weak and partially
paralyzed. She pleads to adventurers to aid her in her a quest. An
artificer of Yothri attacked her and stole her crystal wand. Her soul
is bound to this particular; no amount of magical healing can save her
until the wand is returned. Her immortal nature staved off immediate
death from the poison. She knows the artificer came from an iron
tower perched on an icy mountain in a dimension stuck in an eternal
state of twilight. In addition to the artificer of Yothri, rust monsters and
erinyes (demons) exist in the tower.
The melgara has a large moth-shaped flute. If the flute is played under
the light of a full moon, 1d4+1 astral moths arrive to serve the flutist. The
astral moths obey the flutist to the best of their ability and remain until the
light of day. The powers of the moth flute work once per month. Luckily,
the moon rises full on this very night. In reward for the return of her wand,
the melgara presents the heroic adventurers with the lunar flute. The astral
moths automatically know the path to the artificer’s dimension.

Challenge Level/XP: 15/2,900
The offspring of a demon and a giant, an athatch is a monster about
14ft tall, weighing about 2 tons, with 1d3 eyes, 1d3 arms, and 1d3 legs.
An odd-numbered eye is located in its forehead, an odd-numbered arm
is located in the middle of its chest, and an odd-numbered leg is located
behind its haunch. It is ambidextrous (if it has two or more arms) and can
wield a weapon in any or all of its hands. They use massive weapons,
usually great clubs (2d6 damage). An athatch cannot normally bite
opponents man-sized or smaller in melee, but may (if victory seems
likely) toy with its victims by grasping and lifting an opponent with a
free hand (a to-hit roll is still required) and then biting on the following
round. The poisonous spit of the athatch requires a saving throw at -2 or
the victim becomes helplessly nauseated for 1d3 turns; the athatch also
can spit this poison up to 10ft.
Because of their demonic heritage, athatch have 60ft darkvision and
the following spell-like abilities they can use once per hour: darkness
(5ft radius), levitate, and phantasmal force. Once per day an athatch can
polymorph self into the form of another giant. They subtract 1 point of
damage per die from cold, fire, gas, and lightning attacks against them.

Attack of the Athatch

A brilliant white cloud hovers just a hundred feet above the forest
floor. An aura of silver outlines the ever-changing billowing shape. A
magnificent castle of enormous proportions majestically stands atop the
cloud. A regal giant adorned in golden plate mail armor slowly floats
down from the clouds. She wears a kindly smile and wields a two-handed
sword shaped like a lightning bolt. She says her name is Thiassi and needs
the help of “wee folk” as she calls the PCs. She tells of a gang of ogres that
stole her singing harp. The ogres hide in a cave too small for her to enter.
Thiassi (actually a polymorphed athatch) lures victims to the ogre den
then springs her trap. The illusionary cloud castle disappears after her
defeat. The nearby caves hold 6 ogres loyal to Thiassi. After the ogres
pour out of the den to attack, Thiassi attacks spellcasters from the back.
The ogres and athatch have accumulated a substantial amount of loot
using this ruse. The caves contain the remains of past victims and three
chests. The first chest holds 606 gp, 2,108 sp and 6 cp. A massive horn
made of dragon bone sits in the second chest and the third chest has a
wand of polymorph other (5 charges) and a +2 two–handed sword.

Tears of Sutur

A grand pool of molten iron sits before a gargantuan statue of a longbearded fire giant. The statue represents Sutur, the fire giant god. The
shrine (oddly not made by fire giants) lies abandoned in this lofty cavern.
The giant sits with its legs around the radiant pool, lounging against a twohanded sword. The statue wears gold plate mail (550 gp if peeled from
the statue) and a blackened crown of iron. Tears of molten metal fall from
his eyes, down the wavy beard, over his portly belly and into the pool.
The metal handle of a weapon breaks the surface of the pool. The handle
glows brilliant red with heat. The handle belongs to a massive +1 flaming
warhammer (treat as a two-handed sword). The hammer deals an extra
1d6 points of fire damage and sheds light as a torch. Only those with the
strength of an ogre can wield the hammer properly. Once approached, the
tears Sutur roll down the beard and transform into 6 azer. The azer defend
the shrine and hammer. The azer throw balls of molten iron (1d6+1 points
of damage) before attacking with searing weapons.

Tall grasses sway in the gentle breezes blowing across the open prairie.
Blue asters grow in fragrant clumps, while honey bees buzz noisily

mounds of dirt are tossed about in random piles, the fresh loam heavy with
clay and peat. An aggressive giant badger hunts the plains, digging new
dens every couple of days and rotating through past lairs as it patrols its
territory. It erupts from the ground to attack anyone walking among the
dirt mounds. Its most recent den contains a dwarf corpse. The corpse has a

pass. He wears the fur of a grizzly bear, and carries a massive club made
from the leg bone of some giant beast. Ferck demands gold from anyone
trying to go past his boulder, and attacks those who refuse. Ferck is
clumsy, and his wild swings with his bone club are made even worse by
the fact that he is missing both of his index fingers. Ferck carries a couple
of small sacks on his belt. One has six worthless nuggets of fool’s gold,
32 silver pieces, a ruby worth (60 gp) and a dead skunk. The other sack is
actually a bag of teeth. Ferck lost both of his fingers when he poked them
into the bag to get to the shiny coins inside.

Banshees are horrid faerie (or undead) creatures that live in swamps
and other desolate places. Their shriek (once per day) necessitates a
saving throw versus death or the hearer will die in 2d6 rounds. They can
travel over water and other terrain as if it were land, but crossing running
water causes them to lose their magic resistance for 3d6 hours. They look
like gaunt humans (male or female) with long, stringy hair and glowing
yellow eyes. They often wear hooded cloaks. At the Referee’s discretion,
such creatures might be undead rather than faerie-folk, and are considered
Type 9 undead for turning purposes.

Screaming Bells

The vacant Seneteal Monastery sits in the high ridges of the Forlorn
Crescents, the empty halls open to shrieking winds blowing through the
barren peaks. Jutting rock handholds lead up a sheer cliff to the bonemesh gates and the carved columns supporting the flat-stone roof where
six ancient bells hang inside an enclosed belltower. The bells ring once a
day, a depressing sound that bounces through the mountain peaks.
Rumors of death magic practiced in the monastery keep most away.
Anyone venturing inside finds the bones of the master monks slumped in
rotting saffron robes in the main hall. A lone figure still walks the halls,
however. The old man wears a black robe and hides his face under a deep
cowl. Ellyllon was an elf warrior who visited the monastery to learn the
secrets of the world and to achieve his own inner peace. He instead found
ancient words carved into the hollow bells. Reciting them turned him into
a deadly banshee. He rings the bells daily to bring about the end of the
world. The bells cause confusion in anyone hearing them if they fail a
saving throw. Ellyllon uses his shrieks to set them ringing before tearing
into intruders with his claws.

Blood in the Water

A suspended wooden bridge crosses 30 feet above the surface of a
60-foot-deep pool of cold, clear water filling this cavernous chamber.
Small waterfalls drop from the ceiling to create rippling currents in
the water below. The bridge is shaky, but supports the weight of those
crossing it.
A locked chest sits in the center of the swinging bridge, bolted through
the bridge’s wooden planks. The chest’s locking mechanism is connected
via interlocking latches to supports holding the bridge in place. Unlocking
the chest simultaneously unlocks both ends of the bridge, dumping the
entire structure into the water. The chest contains a potion of levitation in
a stoppered flask, a ruby ring (100 gp) and an open pot of cow’s blood.
Rope pulleys automatically hoist the bridge out of the water and re-latch
it in 2d6+2 rounds.
The pool is home to 12 barracudas that swim out of tubes near the
bottom of the pool to attack anyone floundering in the water. The cow’s
blood spreads out of the chest in a murky cloud, driving the barracuda
into a frenzy.

Mirror, Mirror

Dark, ruffled curtains cover dozens of full-length mirrors lining this
wide hallway. Each mirror has a bronze frame and stands 15 feet tall and
10 feet wide. Sitting on a white pedestal table in the middle of the hall
are a silver hand mirror (60 gp), a melted candle, a gold bell (10 gp) and
a quill pen. Most of the mirrors are harmless, but one is a portal to an
extradimensional space containing a trapped basilisk just waiting for the
curtain to be pulled aside to release it. The basilisk charges out, trying to
turn anyone in the room to stone. The creature was trapped in the mirror
by a powerful mage who then placed the glass here to deter intruders. The
items on the table belonged to the wizard’s wife. He keeps them here to
preserve her memory, but they otherwise serve no purpose.

Challenge Level/XP: 6/400
Desert basilisks appear to be fat cobra snakes, about 20ft long and
2ft in diameter, with four skinny legs that help propel them along the
ground and with horns all around the top of the head. These basilisks
are extremely poisonous—so much so that even their gaze inflicts 1d6
points of damage unless those meeting its eye make a successful saving
throw. Anyone avoiding the basilisk’s gaze attacks with a -4 penalty to
hit and damage. In addition, a desert basilisk can spit its poison up to
20ft as a missile attack for 1d12 points of poison damage. The desert
basilisk’s bite inflicts 1d4 points of physical damage and the poison
inflicts an additional 1d12 points. A saving throw negates the basilisk’s
poison, but anyone who purposely comes into physical contact with a
basilisk’s hide automatically takes 1d6 points of poison damage. Any
weapon that strikes a desert basilisk becomes envenomed and does
and additional 1d12 points of poison damage to the next target it hits.
Desert basilisks are solitary monsters, indigenous to desert regions,
but are sometimes transported elsewhere by wizards looking for exotic
guardians.

The Serpent’s Drink

The nomads of the Fannuk Desert speak of an oasis in the middle of
the shifting sands where the waters of life also bring deadly risk. The
massive waterhole is nevertheless an irresistible temptation to those lost
in the desert. Anyone nearing the water finds sandy humps of fur from
decomposing camels kneeling along the bank. Thick reeds grow around
and through their corpses. The body of a nomad lies 20 feet from the
water’s edge, his face blackened and his throat bloated.
The water is poisoned by a desert basilisk hiding under a rush of
reeds near the bank. Drinking the liquid has the same risk as touching
the basilisk’s hide. The basilisk slides through the water with a ripple of
curving waves before rising out to attack.

A Wing and a Bear

Guttural growls reverberate through the darkness as something large
crashes through the pine trees. Tree limbs crack and crash to the ground as
a brown furred beast spirals overhead. Massive bat wings extend outward
as the monster dips and slides around the tree trunks. Four massive paws
claw the air. A moment later, the beast swoops into the PCs’ camp and is
revealed: a grizzly bear with large wings spreading from its back. The
grizzly roars in pain as it slams hard into the ground.
The wings separate almost immediately from the grizzly’s fur as the
angry bear tumbles headlong across the dirt. A bat monster swoops
upward and away from the injured animal — and then banks for a return
pass at its prey. The giant bloodsucker abandons the bear (it was too
difficult to lift anyway) in favor of easier meat. The injured bear takes its
anger out on anyone nearby.

Flowers in the Attic

The abandoned manor house is a blight on the hillside, its shutters
falling, its doors broken open, its porch sagging. A massive oak tree leans
against the side of the house, caving in the roofline and opening the attic
to the elements. Flowers grow up the tree and across the roofline. Fragrant
purple petals can be seen growing in the open attic.
The house is empty and has been for many years. Nothing of value
remains after looters and vandals tore the place apart. The attic is now
home to 6 giant bats that hang from the roof supports during the day. The
bats flutter out as the sun goes down in search of prey. A dead mule lies
amid the flowers growing wild in the thick bat guano.

Thief in the Night

An industrious black bear makes frequent forays into the Silver Plow
Tavern. The animal climbs onto the building’s flat second-story roof and
then pulls open the shutters to get into guests’ rooms. The animal has
avoided traps set by the owner, and is quite adept at breaking and entering.
The shutters are clawed and scratched from its past entries. Once inside,
the bear takes the room apart looking for food. It trashes tables, turns over
beds, tears open packs, and crunches loudly on anything edible it finds.
The bear scampers into the night after its theft unless disturbed. Anyone
sleeping in the room gets a violent wake-up indeed. The noise in the hall

Campfire Terror

A campfire burns brightly in this small clearing, the roaring flames
pushing back the inky blackness. Three forms lie around the fire’s
welcome warmth. But the twisted, contorted bodies will never feel the
heat washing over them. Each man is dead, ripped apart in his sleep. Picks
and sieve pans lie scattered around their bloody bodies. One appears to
have been reaching for a weapon when his head was torn off. Ripped open
bags of food lie on the edges of the destroyed camp. Half-eaten loaves of
bread and dried figs litter the ground. Four burros lie dead in a small copse
of ash trees near the camp. The animals’ guide ropes are still tied to the
overhanging branches.
The treasure hunters ventured into the woods to pan for gold, but
instead found an angry grizzly bear waiting for them. The grizzly killed
the men and their pack animals, and then tore apart the camp looking for
food. It fell into a deep slumber in the warm pile of dead burros to sleep
off its meal. It rises to its feet and attacks if disturbed.

Hot Water

An 15-foot-tall ice cave leads into the sheer wall of the Wailing
Glacier’s sheer cliff. Thick icicles hang from the cavern’s mouth, and
snow drifts nearly block the icy entrance. The tunnel extends 300 feet into
the cold glacier. At the back of the cave is a 15-foot-wide pool of heated
water. The well is 40 feet deep. Underwater steam vent keep the water
above freezing. At the bottom of the well are several bodies of three snow
nomads. Their bodies are ripped and torn. One body still wears a ring of
cold resistance (wearer receives +5 to saving throws vs. magical cold and
is immune to normal cold).
Anyone diving into the warm water finds several smaller passages
that split off from the underwater well. These tunnels wind upward to
chambers inside the glacier. One cave is home to a polar bear. The bear
swims up the well and leaps into the room to attack intruders. The bodies
in the water are its past meals.

Angry Bees

A wooden stand supports a bulging scarecrow that stands in the center
of a field of poppies and wildflowers. A floppy hat sits askew on the
dummy’s pumpkin head. The scarecrow’s burlap mid-section is filled with
more sewn-in ripe pumpkins. The dummy has a squishy feel to anyone
prodding it. The entire cloth mannequin is coated with a sticky gel and
sprinkled with fragrant pollen. The body of a wizard in pale green robes
lies at the feet of the scarecrow. The corpse is bruised and bloated. Large
welts raised on the body leak a golden liquid.
The wizard researcher Morlae Reeve placed the scarecrow to gather
poison from a nest of giant bees located in the field. His plan didn’t work,
but the dummy did rile the bees up. They swarmed the poor, allergic man
before he could run. Anyone approaching the scarecrow or the body is
attacked by 1d4+1 giant bees that rise from the swaying grasses to attack.
The attacking bees draw others from the hive, with 2 more giant bees

Beetle Bane

The burly barbarian Axxhammer Kronk hates wizards. A sorcerous
minion of the dark gods killed his favorite pony when he was a child, and
Kronk’s anger has known no bounds since that evil day. Kronk carries
a massive battle axe over his muscular shoulder. He notches the handle
each time he slays a mage (or someone he thinks is a mage; Kronk isn’t
particularly bright). Kronk stands nearly 7 feet tall and has a curly red
beard that drops nearly to the wide leather belt he wears. Kronk is missing
his left eye. A foul wizard jammed a wand into Kronk’s eye socket before
the barbarian sliced off the man’s head. The wand shoved into his skull
didn’t do any damage to the dimwitted barbarian’s intelligence.
Skittering in front of Kronk are 2 giant arcane beetles. An iron spike
is driven into each beetle’s carapace, and a silver chain is attached to each
spike. Kronk keeps the other ends wrapped around his massive hand.
Kronk yanks the chains occasionally to keep the beetles in check. The
beetles learned long ago not to mess with the irritable barbarian. He keeps
the beetles between himself and any wizards he encounters until he can
get close enough to use his axe.

Buyer Beware

Lamp seller Amaz Juventia promises that his lamps last for months
(they don’t), are unbreakable (they aren’t) and bring great adventure to his
buyers (they do). Each lamp is little more than a hollow wooden cube with
panels on four sides that slide open and shut. A crude brass handle sits on
the top of the lamp. Some of the lamps are painted with elaborate scenes
(600 gp), but the majority Amaz sells are unadorned wood (10 sp). Each
illuminates a 30-foot-radius for up to 3d4 days. They don’t require any oil.
Amaz claims the lamps are perfect for adventurers going underground.
He says the light from the lamp causes jewels to glow in their presence.
To prove this, he points to a number of glowing rubies sitting in a locked
cage on a table behind the counter. The glowing jewels are fakes, and
enchanted with a permanent light spell to produce the glow. The lamps
have no special effects. Opening the lamp reveals a squishy lump of
glowing organic material. The lamps have a 10% chance of spontaneously
catching fire each day.
Amaz recently plowed over a nest of giant fire beetles near his home.
His wife wades into the nest each morning wearing a special pheromone
to repel the beetles. She harvests the insects’ light-glands, which Amaz
quickly stuffs into lamps to sell before they go out. Amaz’s stall in
Bargarsport’s bazaar is liberally doused in the pheromone to repel the
insects. Anyone who buys one of the lamps attracts 12 giant fire beetles
within 2d4+2 rounds.

The bottle is a portal to an elemental plane. If the cork is removed or the
bottle broken, the portal opens as a massive storm cloud above the bottle.
The clouds that roiled above the tiny ship billow and clash above the PCs
as lightning flashes. Wooden planks drop through the portal to land heavily
around PCs. The figurehead of a sailing ship follows, thudding into the
ground. In 1d4+1 rounds, a lightning bolt erupts out of the hole to strike
the bottle (or its shards). The bolt does 6d6 points of damage (save for
half). After the bolt strikes, a shimmering form wavers into existence. A
behir is unceremoniously dumped into the middle of the room a moment
later. The angry creature drops from the air to land heavily on the tiled
floor, then immediately attacks those it assumes brought it here.

Birhaakamen are bird-men, entirely feathered, with beaks and clawed
hands at their wing-joints. They live in tribal aeries and are generally not
civilized. They carry javelins, and some of the more civilized aeries arm
their warriors with spears and shields. These more advanced bird-men
may wear scraps of armor, increasing their AC to 4[15].

Bird Men of Aly-Katraz

Stroud Island sits shrouded by mists in the middle of the uncharted
Reaping Sea. The island has high, treacherous cliffs that are nearly
impossible to climb. Dangerous coral reefs keep ships from easily
approaching the sandy beaches. High atop one rocky crag sits the aerie
community of Aly-Katraz, a nest-city of birhaakamen who don’t look
kindly upon unwanted visitors. The bird-men ride the thermal updrafts
around their home, sweeping down in waves upon sailors who dare to land
upon the white sand beaches. Captives are kept in gilded cages suspended
over 300 foot drops for predatory birds to peck apart.
Sitting on a stone pedestal on the south beach is a golden eagle statue.
The statue faces outward, staring out at the sea. The idol is worth 300
gp and weighs 600 pounds. The idol grants the owner the ability to take
flight as a giant raptor once per day. Flights of 10 birhaakamen soar on
the thermals above the beach, keeping an eagle eye on the precious statue.
The birhaakamen believe that if the idol leaves the island, they’ll lose
their own ability to take to the skies.

Come Blow Your Horn

Six oversized curving stone trumpets sit on a ledge overlooking a
200-foot-deep pit. The bells of the trumpets point horizontally out over
the drop. A plush velvet-lined tray before the stone instruments holds
six bronze mouthpieces (20 gp each) that fit into the trumpets. Each
mouthpiece has a different-colored gem affixed to it. The trumpets produce
clear, clean notes and cause colored lights matching the gemstones on
the mouthpieces to glow inside the pit. Blowing multiple trumpets mixes
the colors. The lights glow for three rounds before going out. If all of
the trumpets are blown in order, the colored lights form a multi-colored
staircase circling down inside the pit.
One of the trumpets produces a flat, ugly sound if blown, as if something
blocks the interior of the instrument. A black pudding fills the curving
stone. Anyone blowing the trumpet gets a mouthful of black pudding
as the creature oozes up through the instrument to get at the would-be
musician.

Don’t Blink

Strobe lights flash throughout this room, the quick pulses throwing off
the senses. A five-foot-diameter orb floating in the center of the chamber
is the source of the strobing lights. The chamber is home to 4 rabid blink
dogs. The canines blink in and out, their forms flickering from one spot
to the next. The incessant strobing makes it seem as if 10 dogs are in
the room. A dog is seen in one spot before the light winks out, and then
appears across the room when the light returns. Normally friendly to good
creatures, the rabies attacks the dogs’ brains so that they attack anyone
intruding upon their den. The central orb traps the diseased animals and
prevents them from leaving the chamber. Shutting it down (by covering
it or destroying it) allows the dogs to escape, but doesn’t cure the rabies
afflicting them. Anyone bitten by the blink dogs must make a saving
throw or lose 1 point of Constitution each day thereafter until cured. The
person dies when their Constitution reaches zero.

Pig Skinned

Human skin stretches across seven wooden frames outside this small
hut located in the Seething Jungle. The skin was removed from the bodies
of men and women in long rolls and then stretched across the frame to
cure. Most of the bodies are men and elves, but one is dwarf skin (stretched
incredibly thin). A fire pit in the center of the clearing has a boiling pot
sitting on the hot coals. Walking around the fire pit are 6 wild boars.
The boars attack anyone approaching the hut. Each pig wears a collar of
interlinked finger bones.
The witch doctor who lives in the hut is a vicious necromancer who

Challenge Level/XP: 12/2,000
When a nugget of pure chaos ends up in the material plane, the result
can be a bone mound, a jelly-like creature that exudes a sticky film from
its pores. At first glance, a bone mound appears to be a massive heap of
bones and broken skeletal remains, for it picks up osseous material that
sticks to the slime-beast’s blob-like form, giving it the appearance of a
pile of bones. This bone-collecting slime possesses a secondary ability
that makes it a truly dangerous foe. In addition to the adhesive film it
exudes, the piece of pure chaos at the bone mound’s core gives it an innate
ability to animate, partially, the bones that stick to it. The effects of this
spell-like ability extend up to 2ft away from the creature’s body. The bone
mound can animate 1d6 of the bony remains that have adhered to it each
round. Each of these animated body parts may attack once, inflicting 1d4
damage. A cleric may turn these newly living bits of skeletal remains as
if they were Type 1 undead. The bone mound may shift its animate dead
power from one set of bones to another at any time.
The chaos nugget inside the mound, which looks like a bit of charcoal,
is quite dangerous - it dissolves instantly into anyone who touches it, and
the victim must make a saving throw at -2 or the nugget will re-form
inside his body and he will become a bone mound himself in 1d6 days.

Death Gnoll

A dying gnoll lies sprawled across a pile of bones in this ossuary. The
gnoll’s breathing is labored and shallow, and his eyes are rolled into his
skull. Sticky sweat gels on his fur. A circle of black scar tissue is burned
into his left palm, and the fur of his left arm is burned and blackened.
A brazier of coals is overturned on the floor at his feet, the cool chunks
scattered over the tile. Skulls sit on stone ledges around the room.
The gnoll discovered a chaos nugget glowing in the brazier of coals
and picked it up. The nugget burned its way into his body through his
palm and is nearly finished changing its unfortunate victim into a bone
mound. In 3 rounds, the gnoll’s body dissolves into a sticky mass and
seeps through the bone mound beneath it. The newly formed bone mound
immediately animates the bones to attack.

A borsin is a creature with the head, arms, and upper body of an ape
joined to the body and legs of a quadruped. The lower half may be that of
a boar, equine, or hound; these may be a race of battle-beasts magically
crossbred in antiquity. A borsin has a savage cunning, and is capable of
problem-solving and setting crude traps. They do not use weapons or
tools, or carry treasure, although pack leaders will drape themselves in
the skins and furs of creatures they have killed – including humans and
adventurers.
Borsin form packs led by the strongest member. They attack with two
claws and a bite, and use pack tactics to drive opponents and prey into
traps, kill zones, or natural hazards such as cliffs and ravines. If both its
claws hit the same opponent, a borsin can hug and rend for an additional
2d6 points of damage. Borsin packs stake out their territory by making
small cairns topped with the skulls of their kills, and patrol their borders
regularly. Borsin are omnivorous and hardy, capable of surviving on plant
matter, yet enjoying a fresh kill.

The Wild Pack

Blood coats the rocks and ground in this dead-end canyon. Parts of
various animals are scattered across the rocky ground. PCs find horse
heads, cow hooves, stringy pelts and even dog collars amid the carnage.
The hoof prints of hundreds of horses are trampled into the blood-soaked
ground.
A pack of 7 borsin hunts the rocky steppes, corralling animals for
slaughter. The borsin have the lower bodies of roan stallions and charge
easily over the rocky ledges of their hunting ground. The pack sleeps
in a cave in another canyon. The creatures post sentries on the hills
overlooking the entrance to the box canyon. The animals frequently run
wild horse herds into the canyon, then descend and kill as many of the
animals as they can. PCs who enter the canyon are targeted for slaughter.
The borsin arrive within 3 rounds for the kill.

In the Valley of the Ocher God

The rifts of the Beharrel Valley are deep chasms in the Seething Jungle
that drop down into a steamy natural hotspot. The massive gouges in
the ground contain entire species of dinosaurs that walk freely in the
sweltering heat. One deep cavern network is ruled by a brainosaurian
known as the Ocher God. The intelligent allosaurus uses a tyrannosaurus
as a guard to protect him from other less-intelligent would-be usurpers.
The Ocher God walks the jungle, using his spells and natural abilities to
shape and control the jungle and its inhabitants. A race of natives scampers
underfoot, desperately staying out of the massive dinosaur’s way. They

Brainstorms are creatures that reside in the ethereal plane of
existence; they are incorporeal, able to move through solid objects and
only vulnerable to magic weapons (and spells). The central body of a
brainstorm resembles an almost transparent sphere with a ghostly-looking
brain at the center. A brainstorm attacks by sending out waves of mental
power in a cone shape, extending 100ft from the creature with a 10ft width
at the origin and 100ft wide at the end of the cone. Anything caught within
the cone must make a saving throw or be affected by one of the following:
1. Charmed (1d6 rounds)
2. Fear (flee for 1d6 turns)
3. Paralysis (1d6 turns)

Brain Death

A pulsating rift hovers 15 feet in the air over an onyx altar in this
blackstone chamber. A high dome ceiling above the opening in the air is
decorated with thousands of mirrored tiles. Two winged stone statues stand
at the ends of the altar, their hands raised joyously toward the glowing rift.
Sixty emeralds (30 gp each) lie on the floor in a circle around the statues.
A ceremonial +1 dagger lies atop the altar. Lying on the floor outside
the gem circle is a freshly killed thief and a skeleton. The thief’s head is
missing and his clothing is covered in dark-red blood. The skeleton’s torso
is crushed, his ribs snapped like twigs.
The rift is an opening to the ethereal plane. The dagger is the focal point
that summons a brainstorm if it touches flesh. The dagger doesn’t have to
stab someone; merely touching it with a bare hand is enough to bring the
brainstorm in 1d4 rounds. One of the statues is a stone golem tasked with
protecting the sacred dagger. The golem doesn’t move unless the dagger
is taken, and it ignores the brainstorm when it arrives. The brainstorm
caused the thief’s head to explode as he dodged the golem; the skeleton
was a fighter crushed by the golem years earlier. The thief’s corpse still
has 67 gp in a pouch on his belt.

Wagon Riders of the Purple Plains

A wooden carriage painted garish purple rolls down the dusty road.
It weaves from side to side as the driver attempts to control the massive
steeds pulling it forward at a full gallop. The vehicle nearly topples
once or twice, before miraculously straightening out and staying on its
wheels. The horses charge forward, fear in their wide eyes and flecks of
foam covering their mouths. Hanging out the carriage’s windows are 6
bugbears. The driver (another bugbear wearing a woman’s dress and a
dirty shawl) guides the animals as best it can toward PCs. The bugbears are
armed with swords and bows. This enterprising band of misfits stole the
carriage and horses and now terrorizes the plains by riding down travelers.
Their treasure (kept inside the carriage with them) includes six bags of
molding barley, a keg of ale (mostly empty), a silver serving platter (20

Roughly ten feet in height, a bulette (boo-LAY) is covered in natural
armor plating like that of an armadillo, and has a beak-like head that opens
to show wicked, serrated teeth. These creatures can leap to the attack; in
which case they cannot bite, but may attack with all four claws. Bulettes
dig underground to surprise their prey, leaving a furrow in the ground as
they go, caused by a dorsal crest in the creature’s armor. These voracious
hunters eat horses and halflings with gusto, although they will devour
anything from badgers to plowshares if their preferred foods are not
readily available. Although bulettes burrow, they do not venture further
underground, for they are surface predators. When the dorsal crest of the
bulette is raised (during combat this is usually only after the thing has
been wounded), the area underneath is AC 6 [13], and this vulnerable
point can be attacked if the monster is well enough surrounded for its
opponents to attack from behind as well as in front.
Bulettes, often called “landsharks,” resemble huge armadillos with
wide, tooth-filled mouths. They burrow beneath the ground, and surge
upward to attack prey. Bulettes can grow to be ten to fifteen feet long.
Horses are a favorite food of bulettes.

The Ol’ Hitching Post

A six-foot-tall wooden hitching post stands on the edge of a field of
switchgrass. The slender post has a carved horse’s head atop it, with the
mouth of the animal forming a slot. A sign hanging around its neck reads
“One gold.” Any gold piece placed in the horse’s mouth rolls down a
cleverly concealed twisting strip of wood that winds around inside the
post. The coin vanishes at the bottom of the ramp, disappearing into thin
air. A moment later, a horse appears beside the post.
The hitching post is a magical summoning item a wizard crafted to
rent steeds to needy travelers. The summoned horses are real, and last for
12 hours before vanishing. The post can summon up to 6 normal horses
per day. The pole cannot be removed without permanently destroying its
magic. The horses are branded and cannot be sold or traded.
Summoning a horse draws the attention of a nearby bulette. The
creature normally dines on the wild horses that roam the prairie, but won’t
pass up an easier meal. The bulette craves horseflesh above all other meat.

Contagious Camel Confusion

Bundles of stained silk and broken kegs of ale line the road. The corpses
of robed men holding scimitars lie trampled and broken among the refuse.
Hacked and slashed camels and mules from a caravan also lie dead along
the path. Jarwal, a rich and plump silk merchant, hides in the wagon as
a group of 4 camels attacks the wagon. The camels batter the enclosed
wagon with their hooves and spit. The caravan’s pack animals contracted
a rabies-like disease. The disease enrages the animals into a violent and
deadly rage. The animals turned on the caravan guards and teamsters.
Only Jarwal survived the animal uprising. Jarwal rewards his liberators
with a few jars of figs and a bolt of silk (50 gp).
The camels spit foamy saliva into opponents’ faces before engaging in
berserk combat. The disease (saving throw versus poison to avoid) causes
confusion in the victim. The disease runs its course and lasts for 1d4
days or until magically cured. During this time, the inflicted individuals
continue to act as if under a confusion spells.
Each round, the creatures do the following (roll 2d6):

Dragon Flies

A large overhang of rock sits at the base of the White Rock Cliffs.
While the ceiling of rock is too shallow to be called a cave, the alcove
offers plenty of protection from the elements. The area under the
outcropping was the site of a recent and violent battle. Small trees lie
splintered and toppled. The ground bears stains, scars and burns worthy
of a clash between armies. Deep within the alcove lays the body of a huge
red-scaled dragon. Its head, claws and a majority of its scales are missing,
assumedly kept as trophies. The dragon is decaying although it remains
mostly intact for the moment. A rotting foot of a human juts out from
beneath the dragon’s decaying body.
Clothing scraps, bits of armor and ruined equipment lie discarded
around the battle site. An abandoned campsite is located near the dragon’s
body, where a party of adventurers stayed to rest, bury their dead and sort
their loot. Three shallow graves piled high with rocks sit adjacent to the
dragon corpse. The bodies (a human fighter, a human wizard and a dwarf)
lie stripped of their usable gear in their final rest. The victors hauled the
dragon’s hoard off in heavy wagons (evident from the deep wagon tracks
leading away from the camp) toward Bard’s Gate to the south.
The foot belongs to a dead rogue buried beneath the dragon’s mass.
He was a member of the dragonslayers who was lost during the fierce
battle. He vanished beneath the dragon’s bulk when it was killed, and
only his limb was revealed as the dragon rotted and shrank. If pulled free,
the corpse still wears boots of leaping and has a pouch containing two
potions (fire resistance and treasure finding) that survived the weight of
the dragon falling on them.
Unfortunately, 3 carrion flies found the dragon’s corpse first. The
carrion flies currently crawl across the back of the dragon as they enjoy
the rotting meal. They lay their eggs in the abundant carcass. Always in
search of a fresh meal, the carrion flies attack PCs approaching the dragon.
The carcass is filled with carrion fly maggots. The corpse appears to ripple
upon closer inspection as the maggots burrow under the remaining skin.
In their current stage, the grubs don’t pose a threat. The grubs mature into
5d8 adult carrion flies in under a week.

Feral undead cats look like they were created by zombie-raising magic,
but they are actually things quite unlike normal animated undead such
as skeletons or zombies. These undead cats are possessed of an animal
cunning akin to that of ghouls (although with less intelligence), and they
are not slow moving as zombies are. Like ghouls, they tend to form into
packs. If a person is scratched more than three times by undead feral
cats (not necessarily the same one), he must make a saving throw or
be paralyzed for 1d6 turns. After the first set of three scratches, every
subsequent scratch requires a saving throw.

Cat Lady

A dilapidated hut of logs, sod and thatch sits surrounded by an unkempt
and untidy garden. Dozens of domesticated cats flee into the overgrown
brush at the approach of visitors. Pungent, lazy smoke pours from the
chimney. A hand-painted sign reads “Auntie Meme; Seer, Mystic and
Alchemist.” The ancient Auntie Meme (Lawful, female elf, magic-user
5) has led a long and hard life, even for an elf. Perhaps centuries old,
Auntie Meme walks hunched over, relying heavily on her ash-stick cane.
Perceptive visitors might discover that she wears salvaged metal greaves
to protect her ankles and shins under her shredded layers of robes. Auntie
Meme has the ability to make uncanny yet vague predictions and to create
minor potions with minor side effects.
Auntie Meme has an endearing love of cats. Her cats have been her
constant companions and she cares deeply about them. Unfortunately, her
beloved cats wandered into a necromancer’s garden and were turned into
18 feral undead cats. The decaying felines now surround the shack and
attack anyone trying to leave. Due to her advanced age, poor eyesight and
increasing dementia, Auntie Meme does not realize the transformation
her beloved pets have undergone. She has noticed that they seem friskier
lately, which is why she wears her protective leggings when she goes out
to feed them. Her elfish blood makes her immune to the cats’ paralyzing
attack. If told of the cats’ deaths, she grieves the loss of her children.
However, PCs might also replace the cats without her noticing a difference
to save the old lady any heartache.

Silent Farm

The crowd pushes past and ignores a starving blind man lying in the
gutter. The beggar grabs at strangers’ clothing and pleads for food and
assistance. Farmer Earle, the beggar, has fallen on hard times. Once a
prosperous farmer, Earle lost his way when his eyesight failed him. He
bears a large scar across his face that claimed his ability to see. He also
fears his young wife recently left him with his a newly hired farmhand.
He wandered away from his farmhouse to the barn to lose himself in his
work, only to find that his livestock were missing as well. Scared and
alone, he stumbled from the farm to the city hoping to find someone to
help.
Indeed hard times have fallen on Earle, but he doesn’t know the whole
truth. A catoblepas from the Sin Mire Swamp wandered onto his property
and now lives off the abundant food at Earle’s farm. Earle’s wife, his
new farmhand and the livestock are all dead. Their bodies lie in various
spots around the farm. The catoblepas made the barn its lair and hides
there during the day. Earle narrowly avoided becoming the creature’s next
victim when he went out to the barn. Earle has nothing left to offer as
reward. No longer able to farm on his own, he has no future. He may offer
rescuers his farm at a far reduced price in exchange for safe passage to a
shelter or temple where someone will care for him.

Stampede!

From down the road comes a thunderous roar as the ground begins to
tremble. Anyone not immediately taking precautions (such as climbing
a tree or getting off the road), may be caught up in a stampede of cattle
hammering their way down the road. The stampede deals 8d6 points of
damage (save for half). Furthermore 2 bulls stick around after the herd
continues down the path to take out their anger on stragglers. The reason
for the stampede arrives a few rounds after the herd moves on. A small,
animated dog made of metal and wood prances down the path creating
a yipping-like bark. The magical bark instills fear and/or rage in any
cloven-hoofed animal within earshot (saving throw negates), including
PCs’ horses.
Ollie Nematoad, an eccentric halfling inventor, arrives within a few
rounds as he tries to keep up with his newest failed invention. Trying to
create an invention to corral animals, Ollie created this animated dog.
While the dog worked as far as moving the cattle, Ollie found he had little
control over the direction the herd traveled. Ollie rewards adventurers who
stop the animated dog with their own prototype version albeit without the
fear bark. The dog can serve as an ever watchful (and noisy) guard dog
with no attack abilities.

Holed Up Elemental

The smooth floor of this natural cavern looks like highly polish marble.
A small one-foot-tall wall encloses a pool of sparkling water. The pool
sinks below the floor level and looks to be around two feet deep. A copper
pipe sits in the center of the 10-foot-diameter pool and gently bubbles out
fresh water. A drain around the interior edges of the pool keeps the water
circulating. Freshwater oysters line the floor of the pool, each open to
display a radiant crystalline pearl. A worn path circles the pool where an
earth elemental slowly walks a continuous and precise path. Holes are
carved through the earth elemental like porous cheese. These holes have
not weakened the earth elemental despite the numerous openings in the
elemental’s structure. The holes are the result of 6 cave eels that lair inside
the elemental. The eels and earth elemental have a symbiotic existence
and do not seem to impair one another.
The elemental does not deviate from its path if left alone. It attacks
when approached or if the pool is disturbed. The eels attack opponents
from within the holes once the earth elemental wades into combat. The
pool (left over from an ancient dwarf-like race) holds 10d10 pearls worth
100 gp each due to their unique clarity.

Hung Like a Centaur

An odd sight blocks the bridge. A handsome and dark centaur holding a
lance stands at the crest of the bridge. The centaur carries a stout bow and
a two-handed sword across its flanks. Tattoos of black fire cover his torso
and flame patterns are cut into his ebony coat. He wears metallic barding
plate mail adorned with the polished skulls of halflings. Riding on his
back is a similarly dressed human female. She wields a lance, two-handed
sword and wicked bow as well. The pair demands payment for crossing
“their bridge.” They require a toll of 50 gp for each person wanting to
cross. The centaur Mervel and Auggie (human female) extort travelers,
knowing the bridge provides the only safe passage for miles over the
chasm-shored river.
Auggie, once a ranking paladin at Shieldfane, lost her status (and
paladin abilities) due to her forbidden love affair with Mervel. Sentenced
to hang, Auggie and Mervel fled the walled temple of Muir to pillage and
plunder the countryside. The bounty on their return stands at 1,000 gp.
Of course they must be brought in alive in order for their sentence to be
carried out. Mervel wears magical +2 barding plate mail. Auggie wields a
+1 lance and has 2 potions of speed. The two work in tandem, using their
two lances to devastating effect.

Centipede Swarm
Hit Dice: 3
Armor Class: 7 [12]
Attacks: 1 (1hp + non-lethal poison)
Saving Throw: 14
Special: Immune to all but blunt weapons, non-lethal poison
Move: 3
Alignment: Neutrality
Number Encountered: 1d4 swarms in the nest
Challenge Level/XP: 4/120
A nesting of centipedes is a vast collection of normal centipedes, often
combined with a few other sorts of bugs that tend to share the same
living space: cockroaches and spiders, generally. Such vermin are not
appreciably dangerous individually, but when a great number of them are
disturbed at once they can present a serious threat. A party will normally
encounter a nest of centipedes by accidentally disturbing the nest itself.
Moving large wooden beams and prying into ancient masonry entail the
risk of arousing one of these huge colonies. The centipedes of the nest are
treated, for the sake of convenience, as a single monster. The nesting’s hit
dice represent the amount of damage required to scatter and kill enough
of the swarming vermin so that, as a group, they no longer pose a threat.

If a nest of centipedes manages to swarm over a character (either by
landing on him or by moving around him), that character will sustain 1hp
of damage per round automatically from the resulting bites. Moreover,
even if the character subsequently moves away from the central mass of
the nest, he will continue to sustain 1 hp of damage per round until a total
of three rounds have been spend picking away and killing the centipedes
which remain on him. Other characters may assist with this task, each
lessening the time required by one round.

A centipede nest is immune to any damage other than that caused by
a bludgeoning weapon such as a mace (although the mere expedient of
kicking and stomping can inflict 1d2 hps damage with a successful hit).
Any spell which affects an area rather than a single target (such as burning
hands) will inflict double damage. For every five hit points of damage
inflicted by a nest of centipedes against a single opponent, there is enough
poison injected into the victim’s body to cause paralysis for 3-12 turns.
Fortunately, the poison is relatively weak (+2 on saving throw).

Goblins of Kraza Vako

Deep in the forest lays the corrupted fey king, Kraza Vako. Once a faerie king
of wonder and serenity; the encroachment of civilization soiled his nurturing
soul into one of contempt and paranoia. While most of the good faerie folk
fled during his evolution, those who remained became debased and vile. Soon
the might and ill repute of Kraza Vako grew, and chaotic followers arrived in
droves. Masters of guerilla warfare, his recruits now scour the lands
attempting to destroy civilization and law at every opportunity.

Normally dim and unorganized, the goblins of Kraza Vako have developed into
a highly effective horde under his leadership. Kraza Vako’s elite 10 goblins
(max hit points) set up an ambush along a wooded path atop a hill. Six goblins
hide behind small walls and pepper travelers with arrows. They also have small
rounded casks filled with powdered manure and ammonia. They light fuses jammed
into the casks before rolling them down toward victims. The casks explode in
a 10–foot radius for 3d6 points of damage (save for half). In addition,
4 goblins hide above the path near the top of the 150-foot-tall hill. Each is
equipped with bladders filled with 4 centipede swarms. Theses goblins hide on
camouflaged tree stands 20 feet above the forest floor. The air-filled
bladders burst upon impact, spreading the centipede swarm over the area.

The proud Men of Bronze are legendary for their martial prowess and
ferocity. They appear as normal men (albeit unusually handsome and
well proportioned normal men) with a deep reddish-brown skin tone
and are typically armed and dressed in antique fashion. The chalkeions
are the last remnants of a former age, and those few who remain make
their living as mercenaries, for they crave battle above all things. Their
flesh is not literally bronze, but it is exceptionally tough, giving them a
natural armor class of 5[14]. In battle, they usually wear leather armor and
shields (which improves their AC to 2[17]), carry spears and javelins, and
do not typically ride horses. In melee chalkeions function as berserkers,
gaining 2 attacks per round and never needing to check morale. Because
of their fearlessness and strict discipline they are highly sought after as
mercenaries, but it is also well known that the men of bronze place loyalty
to their brethren and self preservation above their employers’ interests and
will not obey orders which they perceive as foolish or suicidal. For every
6 men of bronze encountered there will typically be a sergeant with 6 hit
dice, for every 12 a lieutenant with 7 or 8 hit dice, and groups of 30 or
more are typically led by a captain with 10-12 hit dice.

Princess on a Pedestal

Music and the sound of marching precede the regal sight of men carrying an exquisite woman resting upon a palanquin. Three men wearing
highly polished bronze plate mail play drums, a flute and a lute. Four
similar men hoist the palanquin above their heads. The men have elaborate shields, war spears and archaic bows strapped to their backs. The
men appear to be perfect in every way with flawless, deeply bronzed skin,
finely toned muscles and long, ebon hair. The men are 7 chauklieons (6
hoplites and a sergeant). A young woman of presumed nobility sits upon
a bed of silk pillows. She eats from a gold bowl containing cherries and
figs. She is not flawless like the men, but appears rather delicate and petite. The sergeant commands all they meet to clear the road for Princess
Ashtie. The soldiers do not move and demand that the road be cleared for
the princess’s passage.
While Princess Ashtie truly exists, this isn’t her. Instead, the persona
is a fraud concocted by Tamalyn (human thief 9), a master disguise artist
and swindler. Needing to flee Bard’s Gate because of a 500 gp bounty on
her head, Tamalyn disguised herself and hired the chaulkieons as escorts.
They expect a tidy sum for safely delivering the princess. Tamalyn has the
men of bronze fully convinced of her royalty, but has no way to pay them
when she reaches her destination.

Tamalyn toys with the men. She makes silly demands of peasants,
travelers and adventurers she meets. She often demands that the road be
cleared of large stones or claims the horse/oxen feces offends her. The
chauklieons have even filled wagon ruts and cut weeds from her path.
They have standing orders to toss flower petals upon the ground whenever
she walks, and to rub her feet rubbed with oil when she returns to the
palanquin. The fussy princess might throw strawberries at PCs to anger
them. The chauklieons always come to her defense.

The Chaos Knight appears to be a faintly glowing, ghostly suit of
animated armour. It seems insubstantial, but has a definite physical
presence. There are no features to be discerned within its helm, save for
a dim blue glow. Intense cold radiates from the Chaos Knight; any fire
within 20ft will be dampened or doused, and liquids will cool and turn
to ice.
The mere touch of a Chaos Knight is freezing cold, chilling those it
touches to the bone. It wields a sword in melee, drawing upon otherworldly
might to inflict extra damage.
By concentrating for one round, a Chaos Knight may pass through solid
objects such as a wall, leaving an icy outline where it has done so (3/
day). It can cast Wall of Ice (3/day), cause shafts of ice to erupt from the
ground (3/day), and open a portal similar to a Dimension Door spell (3/
day). The portal remains open for up to 10 rounds, and anyone looking at
it will see a kaleidoscopic passage of jagged energy bolts and whirling,
ever-changing elemental matter. Any being other than the Chaos Knight
that passes through the portal suffers 10 points of damage per round. The
Chaos Knight may pass back and forth between the two end-points of
the portal at will. It may also use Telekinesis once per day, and invoke a
random spell effect twice per day. The Chaos Knight is immune to mindaffecting magic, as well as attacks from non-magical weapons. Normal
weapons with a Bless spell cast upon them can hit and damage a chaos
knight.

Frozen Fire

The doors of this room radiate heat from a lake of magma that lies
beyond them. A 10-foot-wide ledge circles the 80-foot-diameter round
room. Several doors line the walls at intervals along the ledge. Despite the
close proximity to the pool of molten rock, the room remains survivable
and temperate (roughly 100 degrees). The top of the magma lies level with
the solid ledge. A small, 20-foot-diameter island sits in the lake’s center.
A bronze door sits in the island’s center. The dimensional door leads to a
harem in the palace of an efreeti sultan.
A chaos knight stands before the door. A slight aura of blue emanates
from his suit. Even at a distance, it is apparent that the suit of armor is
empty. Despite the lack of a physical body, the hollow helm turns to watch
intruders. The knight attacks anyone who attempts to cross the magma or
to thwart his sworn duty to guard the harem’s door. The magma instantly
cools within 20 feet of the knight as he moves toward interlopers. The
chaos knight’s cold aura ensures that it always walks upon solid land in
the magma-filled room. The magma quickly reclaims the stone as the
chaos knight strides across the molten surface.

Nomengarten

The gnomes of the village of Nomengarten (use halfling stats) live in
great peril. A horrifying chimera moved into their region to terrorize the
hapless community. The young chimera attacks the village at random,
tearing open their huge mushroom houses and devouring the gnome
families within. These weaponless peace-loving gnomes are at the
mercy of the rampaging beast. The eldest gnome summoned a flamingo
messenger to seek heroes to do battle with the chimera. The flamingo
lands near the party with a pleading message tied around its leg with green
twine.
The gnomes dress in earthly colors, but all wear tall, cone-shaped red
hats. These gnomes stand only half as tall as a man and often carry shovels
or small baby animals. Their village is normally filled with singing and
dancing but now remains eerily silent. Despite the occasional burnt
patch or demolished mushroom house, the village appears pristine. Lush
flowers, carved stone animals and elaborate fountains fill the village and
the land around it. The gnomes have a pot of gold (500 gp) and dozens of
cherry pastries stashed away to reward heroes.

its absurdly long arms which end in long, viciously sharp claws. The arms
themselves extend to 5ft, with the claws reaching 2 to 3 feet. With such a
long range, the clawed fiend isn’t limited to attacking foes directly in front
of it, but may also attack those up to 8ft away. Although clawed fiends can
inflict devastating damage on their foes by way of their vicious claws, they
are slow critters, and are penalized with a -1 to initiative rolls. Without the
digits required for fine manipulation, clawed fiends are unable to employ
weapons of any kind.

Frog Gigging

A teenaged boy sits somberly along the road begging for money. He
pleads with stranger to help him out in purchasing a small boat. The
bruised and battered youth claims he lost his father’s boat in the Sin Mire
Swamp. His father beat him for the loss and cast him out of their house
until he retrieves the old boat or purchases a new one. The young man,
Tobian, claims he was attacked by demonic frog men while frog gigging
in the swamp last night. His father didn’t believe such a preposterous tale
and punished him again for his insolence. Tobian alleges that the frog
demons stole the boat. He managed to escape by climbing a cypress tree
until they left.
Tobian was indeed attacked while catching frogs. He was set upon by a
group of 6 clawed fiends that needed the boat to transport firewood for a
grand ceremony to Tsathogga. The clawed fiends celebrate the upcoming
mating season and plan a huge feast of roast meat (of whatever variety
they can catch) on a swamp island in the center of the spawning pool.
Tobian has little to offer other than his gratitude and a few weeks rations
of frog jerky.

The amphibious Cliessid are small, shelled humanoids with pincers in

writhing tentacles in place of a head. They stand no taller than a man’s
knee. Cliessids live in sluggish rivers, shallow streams, stagnant ponds,
and sewer systems, and can move as fast in, or under, the water as on
land. Some cities have imported and domesticated these creatures for use
in sewer maintenance, but with mixed results, for cliessids are viciously
hostile to any who invade their territory.

Sewer Wars

The city of Bard’s Gate has many domestic problems and faces daily
challenges to its infrastructure. Sanitation remains a constant issue in
order to ward off disease and accumulating filth. Norton Mckiagh, the
chief pipe cleaner, and his workers are well paid. But with recent cuts in
spending by the High Burgess, Norton has had to take shortcuts and trim
the budget. Norton recently bought a pod of 16 trained cliessids from a
traveling entrepreneur, Ollie Nematoad. Ollie claimed the cliessids would
cut costs, work for clams (literally) and be able to access smaller pipes. At
first, the cliessids worked out well. But soon tensions developed with the
pipe cleaners union. Fearful of being replaced, the unionized pipe cleaners
began mistreating the cliessids. Open combat soon broke out between the
two factions.
Unbeknownst to Norton, the cliessids organized under a crab man with
minor mental (charm mollusks only and telekinesis, 50 lbs.) and magical
powers (purify water, create water and obscuring mist). Furthermore,
Ollie neglected to inform Norton that cliessids notorious breeders. If
the cliessids and crab man are not stopped, they overrun the sewers and
demand payment from the elected officials.

Cloaker
Hit Dice: 6
Armor Class: 4[15]
Attacks: Tail (1d8), bite (1d6), enfurl
Saving Throw: 11
Special: Moan, mirror image, darkness, enfurl
Move: 6/12 (flying)
Alignment: Chaotic
Challenge Level/XP: 8/800
Cloakers are manta-like creatures that resemble a large black cloak –
the ivory claws are often even mistaken for a clasp of some kind, as they
are kept folded when the cloaker is at rest. Unfurled, the cloaker has a
span of about eight feet.
Cloakers can attempt to enfurl their opponents during melee combat,
while attacking. If the cloaker hits with its attempt to enfold a target, the
victim is clasped in the cloaker’s manta-like body (a saving throw allows
the victim to escape). The victim is allowed no further saving throws to
escape, although it is possible to attack the cloaker with a dagger from
within its folds. The cloaker can bite an enfolded opponent with a +4
bonus to hit.
Perhaps more dangerous than the cloaker’s ability to enfold an opponent
is its ability to moan, for the cloaker’s moaning is dire indeed, causing a
petrifying fear. Anyone hearing the moan of a cloaker must make a saving
throw or do one of two things (50% chance of each): either flee at top
speed for 1d6 turns, or be immobilized with fear for 1 turn.
Finally, cloakers have the ability to manipulate darkness and shadows.
They can cause darkness 15ft radius whenever desired, and as long as
shadows or darkness are present, they can create shadowy mirror images
of themselves (as per the spell) once per day (1d4 images).

Mood Lighting

This encounter could take place in a large city (as a business) or
populated dungeon (as a single room). A continuous red light (continual
light) beams from a glass globe hanging from a delicate chain outside
this door. This dimly lighted chamber boasts of decadence. Crimson and
ebon veils drape a large round bed of cushions. Delicate silver chains
and manacles droop from the ceiling. Deep draperies hang from the walls
casting dark shadows upon the ceiling from red glass oil lamps. Thick
incense hangs in the air as a eunuch (non-combatant) plays a harp lightly.
A constant and faint moaning echoes throughout the chamber. Within the
shrouded curtains lie three maids of ill repute. While the prices of their
services are extravagant, the delights they offer are unequaled among
mortals.
Two of the ladies of the evening (thief 3) legitimately are what they
seem. But the head mistress (an ogre mage cloaked in illusion) runs the
show. She goes by the name Odessa and for the most part operates an
honest, yet expensive brothel. The costs far exceed expectations (price
is negotiated after services rendered). For those who do not pay, Odessa
has a nasty surprise: She hired 2 cloakers to serve as bodyguards. The
cloakers hang above the bed ready to devour those acting out of line or
skipping out on paying.

Stone Garden

Cries of terror and pleas for help come from a small gnome settlement
deep in a primeval forest. The gnomes of the village of Nomengarten
(use halfling stats for gnomes) again suffer at the hands of fate. While the
majority of the peace-loving gnomes fled into the forest, many of their kin
remain trapped. A cockatrice moved into the village seeking easy prey.
The cockatrice turned a number of gnomes to stone. Their mushroom
houses and animal friends suffered similar fates. Trapped gnomes remain
safe from the attacks of the cockatrice but are captive inside their nowpetrified dwellings. Gnome statues remain eternally frozen in the midst of
menial tasks. Stoned gnomes can be found using gardening tools, pushing
wheel barrels, cuddling small forest animals, smoking pipes, napping
against trees, reading books and holding lanterns.
The cockatrice drank from the gnome’s magical fountain and now
nests in the tangled roots of a petrified tree. Four eggs in the nest have
the magical property of harmlessly turning an imbiber’s flesh to partial
stone (providing a +2 armor class bonus) for 2d4 days. The eggs have no
other benefits or penalties. The eggs remain potent for 2d6 weeks before
rotting (unless pickled). The gnomes have little to offer as reward but
beg rescuers to take the small stone animals (squirrels, cardinals, rabbits,
fawns and mice) from their village. The gnomes see the stone animals as
painful reminders of the cockatrice attack.

This mollusk resembles a growth of rock or coral covered with
several large (but still normal-looking) clams. When a swimmer nears
it, however, the clamper lashes out with long, flexible arms of muscle
for which the “clams” are the tips. These appendages encircle and crush
prey, with the clam-like tip serving as a viciously biting mouth. A coral
clamper normally has four appendages, and these grow to a length of 20ft.
The clamper’s body is protected by its hard, coral-like shell. If one of
the appendages scores a hit, the victim must make a saving throw or be
held helpless by the tentacle-like grasp. The clam-mouth at the end of the
tentacle can attack while a victim is held, but cannot generally reach a
victim other than the one held in the muscle-tentacle.

Clamp On, Clamp Off

The all-female crew of the escort ship the Voyager Vixen lies stuck on a
reef just offshore of the city of Bargarsport. The maiden crew specializes in
the luxury transportation of wealthy merchants and nobility. Although they
are somewhat skilled at seamanship, they are by no means professionals
which explains the ship’s current predicament. The ship is salvageable
and safe from sinking, but stuck fast on the reef. All attempts at freeing
the ship by the Vixen’s crew have failed. Luckily, a small exploration ship
(the Arse Biscuit) arrived to assist. Ollie Nematoad, a halfling inventor,
created a hand-cranked machine that pumps fresh air though tubes (made
of partially sterilized and rubberized sheep intestines). The machine has
six tubes available to be used for breathing underwater. The tubes reach
a distance of 100 feet from the air-pump. Note that this does not allowed
unhindered movement in underwater conditions.
Ollie gladly supplies massive crowbars, weighted boots, and chains to
anyone working underwater. He has ropes along with block and tackle to
attach to a winch in his boat. With this equipment and a lot of hard work,
the Voyager Vixen can be freed in a few hours. Unfortunately a coral
clamper hides under the waves. Its claws are clamed onto the bottom of
the Vixen. The grateful maids of the Voyager Vixen offer free passage
(within reason) to any destination along their route with full amenities.

These stunted, gnarled trees look like worn down, time ravaged tree
trunks ranging in height from 4 to 8 feet tall, with a corpse-like shape,
arms stretched forth, budding from the trunk. Every corpse tree has a
tree ghost (see below) that is part of it. Corpse trees are created when a
vampire or wraith kills a dryad; the dryad’s tree becomes the corpse tree
and the dryad herself becomes a tree ghost. At the base of the tree is an
opening leading to a strange chamber beneath, where the corpse tree’s
victims are slowly digested. The “rising corpse” part of the tree animates
to keep anyone but the tree ghost and her victims from entering the tree’s
chamber. A corpse tree can only harmed by magic and silver weapons.
Magic fire will affect the tree but ice, electricity, and acid will have no
effect, nor will normal fire. The tree ghost instantly knows of any harm
coming to the corpse tree, and she can teleport to the tree to defend it
against harm. If either the corpse tree or the tree ghost dies, the other will
die as well.

Snag Hag

An ashen satyr lies dead on the ground, bunched in a crawling position.
Claw and fang marks mar his dusty gray skin. The satyr’s body instantly
turns to ash that blows away in the wind if disturbed. While the satyr was
visiting a dryad for some afternoon festivities, a hag-like vampire walked
into the glade and interrupted the pair. After being drained nearly to death,
the satyr managed to nearly crawl away. The morning sun instantly killed
the transitioning satyr, saving it from an eternity of undeath. The satyr’s
trail can be followed to a glade of death.

Thick mist clings to the ground in the ugly glade. Wet moss covers
the soft spongy ground. Limbless trees line the edges of this portion of
the Sin Mire. The trees seem to have died quickly and without reason.
In the center of mist stands a corpse tree. An ancient crone stands atop a
decaying stump. She leans heavily upon a gnarled cane. The corpse tree
remains motionless while the crone vampire stands out of reach. The
crone vampire lives deep within the Sin Mire and often ventures onto
dry land to spread evil and death. The crone vampire killed the satyr and
dryad. Transformed into a tree ghost, the dryad hides in one of the many
dead trees surrounding the glade. The dryad animates the dead trees to
protect her master, the crone vampire. The crone vampire’s coffin lies in
a root chamber below the corpse tree. The intricate coffin appears to be
a dead log. Only upon closer inspection can the lid be found. The coffin
contains a ring of spell storing (cleric version with protection from evil
10–foot radius, prayer, and bless), a bronze horn of Valhalla, and manual
of wisdom.

Temple of Kukulcan

A massive cut stone pyramid rises out of the jungle floor. The ancient
temple stands in disrepair, but shows signs of frequent use. Sun-faded
paint covers the weathered stone blocks. Jaguar-like demon heads adorn
the corners of each of the twelve wide tiers. The decaying head of a tribal
warrior sits in each of the sculpted jaguar maws. Narrow and acute stairs
lead to the pyramid’s lofty peak. The flat crest holds a blood-crusted altar.
Matted feathers and turquoise jewels lie in dry piles of gore and bone. A
ceremonial +3 flint knife (1d3 damage) lies atop the altar. The knife is
carved in the shape of a feathered serpent. A jade mask with an attached
feathered headdress (250 gp) sits adjacent to the altar. If either the mask
or the ceremonial knife is removed from the top of the pyramid, the altar
statue of Kukulcan comes to life as a couatl. Only the sacrifice of a humanoid with the knife can turn the couatl back into stone. As long as the
knife remains away from the pyramid, a summoned couatl appears each
month to seek the knife’s return.

Your Mother Has Crabs

A hut of gigantic proportions sits along the beach. The stout hut is
made of entire trees and sits just out of reach of the incoming tide. Tanned
whale skins stretched on racks, a massive cauldron of boiling water over
a bonfire and wind chimes made of giant clam shells leave little doubt
to what creature resides here. Mable Krumbein (or Ma’ Crum as she
prefers) is an enormous human female (about the size – and stats – of
a cloud giant, but she does not gain their special abilities). Despite Ma’
Crum’s appearance, she is nothing more than an elderly commoner who
wants to lead a quiet life. Her problems began many years ago when her
wayward and estranged son stopped in for a visit. He told her the story of
a fish that he had caught. In exchange for its freedom, the fish had granted
him three wishes. Her well-meaning but not-too-bright son wished for his
most prized treasures to increase.
Soon after, Ma’ Crum’s son left for other adventures and her growth
started. Ostracized from society, she ekes out a living fishing for whales
and giant crabs. She trades the meat with the few brave merchants
(namely the Boehman Brothers) who accept her stature. Yesterday, Ma’
Crum tussled with a 50-foot-long megalodon that took a sizable bite out
of her thigh. The shark currently boils in her cauldron. She still needs to
collect giant crabs to keep her trade viable and uninterrupted in order to
satisfy the merchants (and keep them coming back), but her injury stops
her from getting back in the water. Luckily, giant crabs abound in the
area. She needs at least 24 live giant crabs to fulfill her next order. Ma’
Crum supplies all equipment PCs need, including cages, ropes and nets.
In return, Ma’ Crum rewards heroes with a head-sized pearl (2,000 gp).

Crab Season

The Boehman Brothers, a merchant company, work out of the city of
Stormhaven on the Reaping Sea. The large operation has many ships
and specializes in trading unusual merchandise. Recently, the merchants
struck gold selling giant crab meat. The unique meat is in high demand
with upper-class restaurants and exclusive commercial wholesalers.
The Boehman Brothers recently hit a snag. The Turtlehead, their newest
ship, has yet to return from their secret giant crab supplier. The Boehamn
Brothers need able-bodied adventurers to accompany the next merchant
ship to investigate the Turtlehead’s disappearance and protect their goods.
They pay their guards handsomely.
The Turtlehead struck a massive reef and foundered along the coast.
A tribe of crab men built the artificial reef of coral, rocks and salvaged
rubbish that nearly sunk the Turtlehead. Once the ship struck the uncharted
reef, the crab men swarmed the ship, slaying the crew and setting the
captured giant crabs free. While fearful of Ma’ Crum (see giant crab), the
crab men nevertheless declared war on the crab fishermen’s fleet.

Drift Wood

A massive pile of driftwood sits at a bend in the river. Logs, portions
of cabins and even several small boats lie in a pile where the rainy season
floods piled them. Several rotting carcasses of cattle, deer and other
livestock lie tangled in the 20-foot-tall pile of debris. Vultures and rodents
scatter at the approach of unwelcomed visitors. The birds squawk angrily
at the interruption to their meal. Atop the pile of debris sits a partially
buried small chest adorned with a golden eagle icon.
A troop of 4 goblins tugs and pulls on the chest as they attempt to free
the treasure. At the sight of trouble, the goblins pull out small bows and
pepper intruders with arrows. The goblins gingerly climbed the debris pile
without alerting 2 crabnipedes that built a lair in a watery tunnel beneath
the rubbish pile. The crabnipedes attack anyone nearing the pile before
turning on the goblins at the top.
The chest has a magical ability. Just below the golden eagle is inscribed
the word “Aubade.” Speaking this word under the midday sun cause the
golden eagle to animate and fly into the sky, carrying the chest with it.
When the eagle (use the stats of a common bird of prey) reaches a height of
250 feet, it plane travels to another dimension where it awaits summoning.
The chest may be summoned by the person who sent it away, and only if
they stand outside on a sunny day during the noon hour. The command
word must be spoken by the current owner of the chest. If the owner dies,
the chest automatically appears during the high noon hour as close to the
owner’s body as possible. If the eagle is slain, the chest and all its contents
disintegrate in a cloud of dust. Despite its small size, the chest can hold
five cubic feet of matter. The eagle chest currently holds a slingshot, 5
days’ worth of rations, a small cask of ale, a drawing of a rather comely
young woman, a lurid love letter to someone named “Princess Amina,” a
bag of 75 gp, and a cloak of elvenkind.

Crocoman

Rumors say that a crazed man lives on the outskirts of the great Sin
Mire Swamp, defending the stagnant waters against interlopers and
defilers. The man, known only as Crocoman, is a cursed druid bound to
the swamp. Crocoman appears as human wearing reptilian hide armor
and carrying a bone sword made from the fused jaw of a crocodile. Once
Crocoman touches the water of the Sin Mire, he transforms into a human/
crocodile hybrid. His skin fuses with his armor, his mouth grows into a
toothed maw, and he grows a powerful tail (gaining a swim speed and a
bite attack).
Crocoman rides a chariot-like canoe made of bone and reptile skins.
A team of 4 crocodiles pulls the chariot with uncanny precision and
intelligence. Crocoman can control crocodiles and alligators in the Sin
Mire. These creatures guard him with their lives. If Crocoman is defeated,
the spirit of the Sin Mire seeks a replacement. The curse passes to a druid
within the swamp. Although the nature of the curse is a mystery, a cure
may lie within the boundary of the massive swamp.

Fishing Horror Story

An excursion fishing barge named the Wolf Bair travels in large circles
on the water. The barge turns and rapidly moves toward the heroes at
their approach. Paddles on both sides help power the barge, but all of the
oars are currently still. Although no one paddles the boat, it moves with
great speed. The barge owner, Captain Bate, rents the barge to recreational
fishermen. He has extensive knowledge of the surrounding waterways and
knows the prime fishing spots. Four rich merchant tourists are currently
on the barge to enjoy a relaxing evening of fishing. The flat barge holds a
plethora of fishing tackle and equipment. Captain Bate keeps live bait in a
wooden cage just below the water’s surface.
On this particular day, a 25-foot-long giant crocodile ate the submerged
bait cage and snagged the attached line in it toothy maw. The croc is not
aware of the attached barge floating above and swims along looking for its
next meal. Captain Bate realizes the barge’s precarious predicament. He
and his customers stand perfectly still, not wanting to attract the attention
of the monstrous beast swimming below. From a distance, the men appear
to be frozen in time. Upon closer inspection, the men make slow hand
signals and extreme facial expressions of terror (such as looks of wideeyed horror, biting motions, rigorous shaking of their heads, etc…). The
men reward their saviors with several previously caught fish and a large

That’s the Way the Tower Crumbles

What’s left of a tower stands on this rocky mountainside. The tower
once belonged to an elemental wizard who vanished decades ago. His own

approach, 6 crumblers rise from the ruins. The stationary rock spirits
pummel visitors with rocks from atop the mound. The crumblers rise in a
circle around the mound’s peak.
These beings guard a special crystal ball located in the under the
rubble. The crystal ball resembles a convex disc of green stone. The
stone summons one crumbler each week (to a maximum of 6) to guard
it. The crumblers attack everything not made of natural stone within
their reach (including the crystal ball’s possessor). The nearly mindless
stone elemental spirits pummel everything with fists and rocks. Over the
decades they managed to topple the worked stone tower into a huge pile
of ruin.

A strange fungus grown from mineral deposits, the Crystal Growth
appears to be a large, multi-faceted, crystalline lump. It may be mistaken
for a massive piece of quartz, as it is usually the size of a human head.
Crystal growth feeds upon minerals found in the bloodstream of humans,
warm-blooded humanoids, and other intelligent mammals. Despite
lacking any discernible sense organs, the crystal growth can somehow
sense life within 90ft, and anyone touching the crystal growth will suffer
an immediate attack. The crystal growth moves by rolling on its facets,
and can bounce off walls, rock faces, and other hard objects to leap a few
feet into the air. When it comes into contact with bare flesh, it drains blood
at the rate of 1d8 hit points per round. Due to its partly mineral structure,
it is heavy and can knock creatures off their feet by rolling and leaping at
them. Some crystal growths learn the tactic of dropping from above onto
the head and shoulders of targets. As the target may be knocked senseless
by this tactic, the crystal growth is usually able to get in a few rounds of
blood drain before being interrupted by other crystal growths seeking a
free meal. A battle over food between crystal growths is a strange sight,
with combatants rolling and battering against each other.
Reptilian and avian creatures lack the minerals the crystal growths
feed upon, and crystal growths ignore them. Canny reptilians, such as
subterranean lizards and cave-dwelling lizard men, have learned to crack
open a crystal growth and lick out its salty, milk-like juices. The juice of
one crystal growth is sufficient nourishment for one man-sized creature
for half a day, or a full day if it contains blood.

Crystal Bowling

Light refracts into a thousand beams of scintillating colors in this
enormous crystalline chamber. Massive quartz crystals grow in droves
from the ceiling. After growing too large to support their own weight,
the crystals fall to the floor where they shatter into great shard mounds.
Hypothermal vents warm a pool of clear water into a steaming haze that
drifts through the chamber like a humid fog. Fissures near the water spout
columns of steam in a constant hiss that echoes throughout the chamber.
A giant lizardman claims this muggy chamber as its lair. The giant
lizardman formed a symbiotic relationship with a colony of 6 crystal
growths. It hides behind the largest mound of shards. Once intruders enter
his chamber, the lizardman clambers to the top of the mound and launches
the crystal growths at his enemies. The crystal growths roll and bounce
back to the top of the mound to be thrown again. The lizardman carries a
massive axe with a blade of chiselled quartz.

Crystalines have learned to use their faceted crystal-like bodies in
conjunction with light to temporarily blind their foes. On a failed save the
victim is considered blinded and suffers a -4 penalty to hit for the next 1d4

Heart of Glass

A maze of towering quartz crystals lines the edges of a boiling lake
of water in this seemingly endless chamber. The clusters of transparent
quartz reach heights of 20 feet or more. The crystals grow throughout the
room, even in the 30 foot depths of the lake. Condensation from the lake
collects on the crystalline ceiling only to shower back down in a neverceasing rain. The cavern rain keeps the crystals clear and gleaming. Paths
wind through the crystal forest. Composed of crushed quartz, the paths
glisten with water and appear well travelled. Light from several pods of
aqueous orbs illuminate the chamber in a fluorescent green glow. The
orbs usually float above the lake eating the plethora of blind fish.
Two dangers regularly inhabit this spanning crystal forest. A tribe of 12
crystalines hide throughout the forest, cleverly hiding among the crystals.
They stalk interlopers through the forest until enough of them gather to
ambush trespassers. Secondly, a will-o’-the-wisp shares this chamber.
The malign fey creature buzzes through the mineral-forest chamber,
darting in and out of the crystal clusters. Radiant beams of light cast harsh
shadows across the room as the wisp attempts to corral victims toward the
crystalines. The brilliant refraction qualities of the crystals make it nearly
impossible to pinpoint the wisp’s location.
The largest of the quartz crystals stands 30 feet tall at one end of the
room. A translucent faceted stone blue heart sits in the core of the 10-footdiameter pillar. The heart emanates a cold sapphire radiance that pulses
soundlessly. The crystaline tribe worships this heart as their deity although
no discernible powers or origin exist. The heart may be the phylactery of a
powerful lich or a lost artifact of great power.

When the Levee Breaks

Since Farmer Earle lost his vision, wife and farm, his luck has changed.
Shortly after the catoblepas incident, the local church of Atacharya
(goddess of the downtrodden) has donated a hefty sum to his well-being.
Earle (with his uncanny business sense) hired a caretaker (Big Ted) and
expanded his once lifeless farm into a thriving cattle industry. Farmer
Earle has expanded his farmland into the Sin Mire Swamp. With his
ingenuity and now-considerable wealth, he built levees into the swamp
to expand his land. The dams hold the water back and turn once-unusable
swamp into fertile soil.
Over the years, Earle’s farm has turned into a cattle empire. He has a staff
of 50 farmhands and thousands of head of cattle roam the lush dried-out
swamp basin. Unfortunately, rumors of larceny and embezzlement forced
Earle to fire Big Ted. In his anger, Big Ted vowed revenge and left the cattle
ranch. Less than a week later, cattle and farmhands began disappearing.
Earle feels this Big Ted is behind it all, but no one has seen nor heard of him
since he left. Worse still, Earle learned the latest dike built to further expand
his farm is failing – likely sabotaged by the angry Big Ted.
The truth of Earle’s misfortune lies with the newest levee built farther
into the swamp. The encroaching land crossed the territory of a darakel.
While attempting to sabotage the levee, Big Ted met his fate in the
darakel’s jaws. The creature normally hides beneath the swamp scum and
algae waits as it waits for prey to investigate the new dike.

Dark Creeper

Dark creepers are humanoids that stand just under 4 feet tall, always
swathed in heavy, dark cloaks and wrappings. Their flesh is pale and
moist, and their eyes are milky white. Dark creepers exude a foul stench
of sweat and spoiled food, owing primarily to the fact that they never take
off their clothing—instead piling on new layers when the outermost one
grows too ragged.
Dark creepers lurk in the black places deep below the surface of the
world, venturing forth at night or into neighboring societies when the urge
to steal and cause mayhem grows too great to resist. Endless layers of
filthy, moldering black cloth shroud these small creatures, leading some
to believe that the creature inside is smaller still. Usually encountered in
groups, dark creepers flee from bright light, but are quite brave in the dark.
For all the mayhem and trouble a pack of dark creepers can cause,
this is nothing compared to the dangers a tribe led by the taller, even
more sinister dark stalkers represents. Dark creepers treat their tall, lithe
masters almost like gods, presenting them with offerings and obeying
their every whim. Invariably, several dark stalkers serve as leaders to dark
creeper tribes, with all of the tribe’s heavy work and labor falling on the
diminutive shoulders of the creepers, freeing the dark stalkers for their
own decadent pleasures. Yet the dark creepers themselves see no inherent
imbalance in this arrangement—to a dark creeper, a life in the servitude of
a dark stalker is a life fulfilled.
Dark creepers use daggers in combat, coating them with the poison
called black smear. Black smear poison (unless a saving throw is made)
reduces the victim’s strength by 1d2 points per round for 2d6-1 rounds. If
the victim’s strength is reduced to 0, the victim dies. If the victim survives,
the points of strength will return in 1d6 hours. The poison on a blade is
used up when the weapon hits.
Dark creepers (and dark stalkers) are able to employ magic to create
a very deep darkness, much more potent than ordinary darkness/light
spells. This deeper darkness has a radius of 50ft, and several effects: (1)
all normal light sources in the radius of effect are not only extinguished,
but cannot be relit for a period of one hour; (2) all magical light sources
must make a saving throw or be extinguished for a period of one hour;
(3) darkvision will not penetrate the 50ft radius area around the object
upon which the deeper darkness has been cast. Magical light sources that
are not extinguished by the spell are able to function within the deeper
darkness, but convey a range of vision no greater than 30ft.
When a dark creeper is slain, its body combusts in a flash of bright
white light, leaving its gear in a heap on the ground. All creatures within
a 10-foot burst must make a saving throw or be blinded for 1d6 rounds.
Other dark creepers within 10 feet are automatically blinded for at least
1 round.

Night of the Creepers

Imhale Mansion stands on a hillside overlooking the village of
Greenbriar, its shutters closed tight and its paint peeling. Villagers fear the
house and stay away from the overgrown fields surrounding the structure.
The villagers whisper of the horrid experiments a necromancer and his
grotesque son performed there in the dark of the night. The blood-stained
basement still reeks of decay from the night of horrors the pair wrought
on the town’s residents. The villagers would burn the place to the ground
if they didn’t fear releasing the evil the old-timers say is trapped within its
walls. The villagers fear that the recent disappearances of household pets
and the schoolmarm are signs the house’s evil legacy is re-awakening.
The house is indeed home to ancient evil, but not the restless spirits
the villagers fear. A group of 9 murderous black hunters broke through
the rock wall into the basement and set up their lair. The black hunters
travel in groups of three as they skulk around Greenbriar looking for lone
travelers, pets out after dark or drunk villagers. The darklings scamper
through the walls of the old house, moving quickly and quietly to attack
anyone entering their domain. Thick black curtains leave the manor’s
interior in perpetual darkness, perfect for the night-loving cannibals.

The strange and mysterious dark stalkers are apparently a noble sub-race
of the dark creepers. The stalkers dwell in strange villages (some rumors
suggest entire cities) built of stone and fungus, in remote underground
caverns where they are served and worshiped by their coarser, diminutive
kin, the dark creepers. Dark stalkers come to the surface rarely, but when
they do it is on a mission, and with a force of creatures such that it never
ends well for those they seek to rob or torment. Dark stalkers are tall, frail
humanoids with incredibly pale skin. They always wear multiple layers
of dark cloth and black leather armor, yet unlike their lesser kin, a dark
stalker’s garb is always clean and spotless. Each dark stalker carries a pair
of short swords— they prefer these weapons to all others, and coat them
with the poison called black smear. Black smear poison (unless a saving
throw is made) reduces the victim’s strength by 1d2 points per round for
2d6-1 rounds. If the victim’s strength is reduced to 0, the victim dies. If
the victim survives, the points of strength will return in 1d6 hours. The
poison on a blade is used up when the weapon hits.
Dark stalkers are 6 feet tall and weigh 100 pounds.
Dark stalkers have the ability to create a very powerful form of
darkness magic 3 times per day (see dark creeper). All dark stalkers
have the abilities of a level 4 thief. When a dark stalker is killed, its body
explodes in a flash of illumination that causes 3d6 points of damage to
anyone within 40ft (save for half damage).
In a fight, dark stalkers are not above sacrificing lesser creatures,
including dark creepers, to win the day or cover their retreat if things
go poorly. They hate well-lit areas and always prefer to fight under the
cover of magical darkness. Dark stalkers rarely fight to the death if it
can be avoided, preferring to slip away if things begin to look grim. The
origins of the dark stalkers and the dark creepers are shrouded in mystery,
made more difficult to decipher by the fact that the dark stalkers do not
keep records of their history. Many scholars believe that, just as the drow
descended from elves, so too must the dark folk have descended from
humanity, their eerie powers and spell-like abilities the result of generation
upon generation of devotion to profane and sinister magic.

Cult Leader

In a vast cavern, approximately 200 feet in diameter, with a high ceiling
you discover numerous piles of junk. The piles contain all manner of
refuse - rusted armor, broken weapons, candle stubs, bits of cord and rope
- as well as a few good, even valuable items. The junkyard is the abode of
1d4 x 10 dark creepers and their leader, a dark stalker.
The darklings have been collecting bits and pieces for ages, and there is a
1% chance that any useful item resides in the yard, and a 1 in 1000 chance
that a minor magic item is present. The items in question are buried in the
piles of junk and thus take days to locate. The dark creepers have burrows
in the piles of junk, and can find the item in question in mere moments
if they have a mind to. The dark stalker dwells in a tent made of cast off
cloaks over a wire frame atop the tallest pile in the yard.

Darkmantles are flying, octopus-like creatures with skin textured and
colored to resemble limestone. They ambush prey by sticking to cavern
ceilings, and dropping to the attack (they are clumsy fliers). If a darkmantle
hits, it attempts to suffocate its prey by folding its tentacles (and the
webbing between the tentacles) around the victim’s head. If a darkmantle
misses its attack, it will flap heavily into the air to make another attempt.
When a darkmantle hits, the victim makes a saving throw to avoid having
his head enfolded in the darkmantle’s octopoid clutches. If the saving
throw succeeds, no damage is inflicted. If the saving throw fails, the
darkmantle has attached and inflicts 1d4 points of damage, continuing to
constrict for an automatic 1d4 points each round thereafter. Darkmantles
have the ability to create darkness in a radius of 15ft.

Darkness Descending . . . err . . . Ascending

The walls and ceiling of this hall end abruptly. The passage continues on
as a bridge arching out across a pit of impenetrable darkness. The bridge
stretches 50 feet to the hallway on the other side. The walls of this black,
rectangular chamber extend 25 feet from the either side of the bridge. A
blast of air rising from the depths of the pit whips loose items around. A
magical wind blasts upward from the floor straight up to the ceiling. The
wind is strong enough to lift a human-sized creature. Smaller creatures are
tossed to the 20-foot-high ceiling and pinned against the torrent of wind.
Creatures larger than a man are not bothered by the wind. 
The floor is actually only 20 feet below, but a clutch of 8 darkmantles
nests at the bottom of the chamber. The darkmantles learned to control
their flight in the windy room, giving them incredible precision and a flight
speed of 12. The alien creatures keep the floor under magical darkness and
shoot into the air to make diving attacks (at a +1 bonus) against PCs on the
bridge or tossed about by the wind. A number of items are pinned to the
ceiling by the hurricane-force winds. Among the numerous bones, rocks,
scraps of cloth and other refuse are 6 torches, 2 lanterns, 2 ropes (50 feet),
a grappling hook, 23 arrows, a short sword, 36 gp, 127 sp, 16 cp and an

The Deasic, or Ice Creeper, is a creature of living ice, resembling a long,

up to living creatures in their sleep, smothering their air passages and
draining their life heat. Anyone slain in this manner becomes frozen solid,
as the warmth of life is sucked out of them. If discovered before it can
complete its attack, the deasic will defend itself with dagger-like shafts of
ice. It is immune to fire and cold based attacks, and can cause a burst of
icy shards to erupt from its body, three times per day, causing 6d6 damage

No More Mr. Ice Guy

A lonely, two-story cabin sits at the tree line high in the snowy Hollow
Spire Mountains. A warm glow radiates from the windows at all hours,
day and night. Several barns stocked with firewood, frozen meat and dried
fruits sit adjacent to the house. Mounds of snow lie banked against the
back of the house and barns. Dozens of frozen corpses are hidden within
the heaps of discolored snow. Most of the corpses froze while sleeping.
Some appear to have awakened — and died instantly — with expressions
of undying terror.
The house belongs to Erlenmeyer, an elderly, senile man. Erlenmeyer
spent his life as a scout, huntsman, trapper and explorer in the vast Hollow
Spire Mountains. He lived and raised a family here with his wife, Myrtle.
Their children are long gone from the homestead, but Erlenmeyer and
Myrtle had one another. A year ago, however, a deasic robbed Myrtle of
her life force. Her death was too much for Erlenmeyer, who is suffering
an advanced state of dementia. In his confused mind, he truly believes
she still lives. He keeps her frozen body in her rocking chair in front of
the cold fireplace. Myrtle’s body is draped in knitted shawls in an eternal
sleep. Her killer, the icy deasic, still sleeps upstairs.
Erlenmeyer welcomes visitors and attempts to be a gracious host. He
offers visitors his home to escape the weather, to rest and to share a warm
meal in exchange for their company. His emotional instability makes for
an awkward visit, as he descends into fits of sorrow and rage at inanimate
objects and long-forgotten memories.
Why the deasic hasn’t slain Erlenmeyer is a mystery. In fact, the deasic
seems to have adopted him. The creature raids caravans, neighbors and
hapless travelers, and then hauls supplies back to Erlenmeyer’s residence.
It buries victims in the snow and stores the supplies in the barns for
Erlenmeyer to use.  With his mind slipping away, Erlenmeyer doesn’t
realize an alien creature is caring for him. The deasic enters through an
open upstairs window via the mound of snow in back. It has no qualms
about slaying Erlenmeyer’s guests.

Angry Bird

A golden birdcage sits alone on a marble pedestal in this dark, empty
chamber. The well-crafted cage gleams in the light. Jewels adorn the
intricate lace bars. The magical cage is always clean and filled with fresh
provisions fit for a small songbird with brilliant yellow plumage sitting on
a perch inside the cage. The bird sings delightful melodies and hops about
as it playfully mimics sounds in whimsical chirps and tweets.
The stand and cage belie their true nature. The cage is a prison for
an achaierai summoned and forgotten by a wizard ages ago. The cage
forcibly changed the achaierai into a songbird as long as the cage remains
intact and in contact with its stand. The achaierai retains its intelligence
but looses all powers while trapped within songbird form. Once the
delicate cage is removed, opened or damaged, the enchantment breaks,
transforming the achaierai back into its true form. Once the curse is broke,
the achaierai breathes a cloud of confusion as the hellish bird bursts from
the dinky cage.

Garbage Island

Down the Stoneheart River, a massive bend collects refuse, sewage
and other indescribable waste from the city of Bard’s Gate. The swirl
waters pile the garbage into a plodding island reaching a height of 12
feet and spanning 75 feet in diameter. Scraps of wood, rotting vegetation
and occasional corpses of animals and humanoids make up the island. 
The semi-solid island spins slowly in the flowing river. Traversing the
pile is dangerous but not impossible. The island reeks of an indescribable
stench that sickens all but the hardiest of trolls. Clouds of flies move in
great masses that cloak the sun. Despite the amount of carrion, larger
scavengers are mysteriously absent.
A gondola and three rotting passengers lie wrecked and partially buried
atop the rubbish heap. The well-dressed cadavers appear to have been well
dressed aristocrats at one time. The putrid carcass of an enormous otyugh
lies near the center of the island, just below the gondola. Numerous (and
harmless) maggots infest the heap, some of them reaching lengths of 4 feet
or more. The trash hides 12 giant flies that busily mate and lay eggs within
the sludgy portions. An aruak demon feasts within the otyugh. The flies
crawl out of the moldering mass of refuse and attack those interrupting
their ghastly orgy. While the flies distract front-line warriors, the aruak
teleports to attack spellcasters. The aruak attacks with two paddles (1d6,
as mace), an anchor and chain (1d8, as two-handed flail) and a logging
cant hook (1d8+1, as polearm).

Sixth-Category Demon. The Baalroch’s name means, roughly, the Bull of Baal: the Baal-aurochs
(the aurochs was a bull that stood twelve feet tall at the shoulder, and Baal
is an ancient and evil pagan deity). These powerful demons somewhat
resemble vast minotaurs with great, spreading bat-wings; they burn with
the fires of hell and are wreathed in flame. Spells from casters below 6th
level do not affect them, and against higher-level spell casters they are yet
75% immune to all spells. In combat, a baalroch uses whip and sword; the
whip can be used to reach great distances – on a successful hit the victim
is pulled close to the baalroch and burned by the fires of the demon’s body
(3d6 hit points). Baalrochs are sometimes referred to in ancient texts as
Balor or Baalor, which may be the name of a single demon rather than a
term for all of them. A baalroch could be forced or tricked into the service
of a powerful wizard, but the risk would be immense.
Baalrochs may attempt to gate in an ally with a 70% chance of success.
The responding demon will usually be a third-category demon (01-80
on 1d100) but an unusually successful summoning might call a fourthcategory demon (81-00 on 1d100).

Eternal Fire Prison

A dome of shimmering glass dominates this chamber.  The 15-foothigh translucent dome traps a woman amid a floor of refuse. The woman
appears to be starving and feeble. Her clothing is tattered, and her skin is
pale. Her hair lies in long, greasy tangles. A 20-foot-tall whirlwind of fire
dances a ring around the dome. The floor has a burnt ring signifying the
fire’s countless circles around the dome.
Dirt and grime cover the woman, hiding her true beauty. Arcane
symbols and incantations drawn in feces and stains cover the dome’s
floor. The woman is a young and stunningly beautiful magic-user named
Francesca the Alluring. In the midst of negotiating terms of services, a
baalroch demon broke free from her entrapment ward. She fled into the
dome, a permanent ward that protects her from the demon. The dome only
keeps the demons at bay and has no other special abilities. Exhausted of
spells, she survives with a magical spoon that provides her with an endless
supply of food and water. Bordering on madness, Francesca has survived
in the dome for nearly two years. The demon waits patiently for her to
attempt to escape or for insanity to take its hold.
The flame tornado quickly winds downs to reveal the demon. This
particular demon has the ability to transform into a whirlwind of fire.
In this form, it can sweep away any creature with one or fewer HD. In
addition, the mere touch of the whirlwind deals 3d6 points of fire damage
and sets creatures on fire (1d6 points of fire damage per round, save each
round to extinguish the flames). The whirlwind’s diameter is 5 feet.

Coral demons are often associated with the Demon-Lord Thalasskoptis,
although not all coral demons are in his service. These horrific undersea
demons are often found leading large bands of water-ghouls and seawights when on the material planes of existence. Such a group will
generally be composed of 1d6 sea-wights and 1d10+10 water-ghouls.
A coral demon resembles a mass of coral with a vaguely humanoid
shape, but with 4 coral-encrusted tentacles reaching from the body along
with a pair of pincers. On land, they give off a stench of brine and rot so
strongly that anyone coming within 20ft must make a saving throw or
become nauseated for 1d6 rounds.
Coral demons have all the normal powers and resistances of demons,
taking half damage from electricity, cold, fire, and poison gas. They can
only be hit by magical weapons. They are able to cast darkness in a radius
of 15ft and to teleport once per day. In addition, coral demons have the
ability to detect invisibility, cause fear (as per a wand), and to telekinese
200 pounds of weight, each usable at will. If underwater, a coral demon
can summon 1d4 giant sharks, and they can also jet forth a cloud of ink
15ft in radius which acts as a dispel magic spell (12th level of ability) cast
against anyone within the cloud. The cloud persists for 1d3+1 rounds,
and anyone remaining inside it for a second round will be treated for each
round as if the dispel magic had been cast again. They have the ability
to gate in another coral demon with a chance of 15% on land and 40% if
underwater. Finally, all coral demons have magic resistance of 55%.
Clearly, coral demons are considerably weaker on land than under the
water, and they seldom venture too far from their natural element. In the
dark and dreaded seas of the abyss, coral demons are common, and few
other demons venture willingly into the territories they claim as their own.

Slave Ship Zorgue

Just off the coast in the Reaping Sea grows the massive Bleeding
Reef. The reef’s jagged coral emits a constant stream of red gametes to
propagate into the sea. The crimson clouds give the reef its name as it
appears to constantly seep streams of blood. The largest mass of coral juts
from the sea, where a partially submerged castle sits on the reef. It is not
clear if the coral encased the castle, or if the castle grew from the coral, or
who – or what – resides in the barbed palace.
Along the Bleeding Reef lies The Zorgue, a moored merchant slave
ship. About three dozen slaves have survived and remain shackled to
the ship’s deck. They plead to any passing ship for rescue. Swimming in
sluggish circles around the ship are 1d4 giant sharks. The crew of The
Zorgue lurk in the bowels of the ship as 1d6 sea-wights and 1d10+10
water-ghouls. A coral demon lies in hiding, blending into the coral reef
adjacent to the boat. The demon uses the survivors to lure victims within
its reach. The demon devours a slave survivor every few days, relishing
the terror and pain it inflicts. The slaves pledge fealty to their saviors.
Slaves could become servants, henchmen or even followers of the heroes.

Darkswimmers are demons generally associated with the DemonPrincess Teratashia, the ruler of dimensions and spirit bindings. They
resemble long, black eels twenty feet in length, with a mouth full of sharp
teeth and a pair of short, clawed arms.
These demons are able to shift from one dimension to another at will,
allowing them to move through walls and other solid objects and even
to disappear into another dimension entirely. Shifting dimensions in this
manner requires the demon’s full concentration, but causes the demon to
disappear from existence for 1d3 rounds, after which time it will return
with 1d4+1 hit points restored.
Darkswimming demons take half damage from electricity, cold, fire,
and poison gas, and are immune to non-magical weapons. They are able to
cast darkness in a radius of 15ft at will, dimension door and passwall once
per day, and to teleport twice per day. In addition, they have the ability to
detect invisibility, cause fear (as per a wand), and to telekinese 200 pounds
of weight, each usable at will. A darkswimming demon has the ability to
gate in 1d2 other darkswimmers (25% chance).
Because these demons swim through water, air, and solids indifferently,
treating all as an identical material for travel, they can be found in any
element both in the abyss and on the prime material plane. They are 90%
resistant to magic.

Shrine of the Demon Princess Teratashia

The walls, floors and ceiling of this chamber glimmer with highly
polished black granite. Flecks of silver reflect light like a million stars in a
night sky within the glossy stone. Eight pillars of the same highly polished
stone surround a set of central figures. The 80-foot-tall pillars support a
domed ceiling over the center of the 100-foot-diameter-round chamber.
A 20-foot-wide colonnade surrounds the dome center between the pillars
and outer wall. Each of the 10-foot-diameter pillars seems carved from a
single stone. The temperature drops by 30 degrees past the pillars in the
center of the room.
Three large humanoid obsidian glass statues surround a central
feminine figure. The statues appear hairless, nondescript and physically
perfect. The three featureless effigies solemnly stand with arms raised and
the tips of their six fingers touching. Each of the masculine forms reaches
a height of 12 feet. A single, fist-sized white orb appears to serve as a
symbolic eye in the center of their forehead. A dull, pulsating violet light
dimly smolders from within each of their chest cavities. 
The giant figures stand around a concave depression about 10 feet in
diameter. A feminine form of the same smooth glass stands on the tips of
her toes in the bowl-shaped depression. The form has two dull crimson
eyes (where eyes should be normally located) on an otherwise featureless
face. The woman’s six-fingered hands clasp one another in prayer between
her breasts. She is slightly larger than an average man. The feminine statue
always seems to face visitors. It flawlessly shifts despite the location of
the viewer regardless of concealment or magic. No matter how many
viewers, the female statue appears to stare at each individually. To each
viewer, the statue only seems to hold its gaze upon them.
This mysterious shrine to the demon princess Teratashia holds many
secrets, none of which are given up easily. Lurking within the pillars
are 2 darkswimmer demons. These alien demons serve as the shrine’s
guardians. The darkswimmers attack from within the pillars, targeting
those alone or near the stone columns first. The shrine may be used to
commune or beseech the aid of Teratshia. The shrine may also have the
power to open portals to extraterrestrial dimensions or to the abyss itself.

Bowels of Hell

A ghastly stench emanates from this cavernous chamber. Sinewy
excretions cover the surfaces in a sticky tangle of glistening, congealed
bile. Cleaned and gnarled bones of rodents and larger creatures lie
scattered along the floor. Snarls, grunts and flatulence permeate the humid,
disgusting air. Shallow ponds of indescribable ooze and excrement pool in
the corners and low areas.
An enormous sludge-like tumor flounders in the room. The growth
resembles a grey, pallid, disemboweled stomach. With no obvious sensory
organs or even a semblance of a face, the vein-covered lump writhes
as if in pain. Surrounding the tuberous cyst are 6 dretch demons. The
gluttonous demons bounce around the swollen bulb in a chaotic ritual. 
With a great heave, the malignant mass defecates a slime-coated dretch
out its long, tube-like tail. Vague faces and appendages of developing
dretch stretch its emaciated skin from the inside. The demons claw and
pummel within the visceral knob, causing it obvious pain and anguish.
The dretch-producing organ has no other attacks other than its repulsive
appearance and appalling odor. The entrail-like monster does not have any
purpose other than to excrete dretch into this dimension from its sphincter.

The erinyes, the “furies” of Ancient Greek mythology, are female
demons who pursue those guilty of crimes against the order of the gods.
Their appearance is so terrible as to cause fear (saving throw). They are

objects at will. The furies carry a whip, which, if it hits, entangles the
victim (saving throw) until the fury releases it. The furies are immune to

Tail Spin

A massive raven flies high above, casting a huge shadow over the land.
The raven has a 65-foot wingspan and clutches an ornate bronze cage.
Two human woman hang shackled from the cage’s exterior. It is unclear
from a distance if the humans are unconscious or dead. The women wear
silken gowns and tattered flower headpieces. A crossbeam sits across the
top of the massive cage and serves as a handle and perch for the raven.
The cage contains an unsteady unicorn bouncing around on the jarring
flight. Battered and exhausted, the unicorn remains proud and glorious.
The magnificent beast in the cage bellows in panic to anyone within
sight. Two winged women escort the raven. They brandish archaic bronze
swords, and barbed whips hang from their belts.
The 2 erinyes usher the raven and their prize toward a wizard’s tower
high in the Hollow Spire Mountains. The erinyes used the maidens as bait
to lure the unicorn from its enchanted forest. The wizard summoned the
eriynes to capture the unicorn for his own nefarious purposes. The giant
raven flies in a circle if the erinyes break off to enter combat. The raven
drops the cage if it receives 10 or more points of damage from a single
attack. The raven flees (possibly with a PC or the cage) if wounded below
a quarter of its hit points.

Dead Ringer

Wedged in the crook of a tree branch 20 feet up lies an unmoving,
robed humanoid. The figure appears mostly unconscious as it weakly
moans in pain. The strangely beautiful androgynous figure wears airy
white silk robes stained with spatters of blood. Two vertical openings
down the back of the robes reveal jagged and bloody bone protrusions.
Aside from not having any discernible sex, the humanoid appears perfect
in every way. The angelic creature is weak and disoriented. Athelstan,
an angel, encountered a particularly vicious glabrezu named Galosc on
a dimension bordering the material plane. Athelstan journeyed from its
heavenly abode to deliver a message from the gods (possibly to a PC). 
Galosc, renowned for its ability to hunt and slay angels, tracked
Athelstan down. Whether Galosc attacked Athelstan to prevent the
message from reaching its intended target is up to the Referee. Galosc
ripped Athelstan’s wings from its back, and then began to methodically
torture the helpless deva. Mortally wounded, Athelstan managed to escape
to the material plane, leaving Galosc to simmer. Athelstan has just enough
strength to open a portal once more to the quasi-plane where Galosc lurks.
Athelstan perishes soon after the portal opens.
Galosc leaps through the portal to finally butcher the angel. Galosc
wears the halos of past prey as bands around his massive upper arms. The
halos (now made of dull lead) provide the demon a +1 bonus to attack
rolls.

Grimleks are large wolf-like demons covered in dark, ratty fur. Their
most striking features are over-sized canines that prevent their mouths
from closing and their lack of eyes. The absence of eyes does not
negatively affect them. They are often used in the service of powerful
demons and sorcerers as guards, trackers, or assassins.
A Grimlek may “latch on” to a victim after a successful attack, causing
1d6 points of damage every round until the victim is freed from the bite.
Their bites can also cause a lycanthropic-like disease if the victim is not
cured before the next new moon, at which point the infected person will
become a hybrid similar to a werewolf. At this point even more powerful
healing magics are needed to reverse the effects before the following new
moon or the person will fully transform into a Grimlek and be lost forever.

Wolf Blitzkrieg

The rocky wasteland of the Ghest Caldera presents dangers few live
to tell about. Nestled in the Hollow Spire Mountains, this volcanic
depression thrives with hostile life. Rivers of lava, boiling lakes and
clouds of poisonous gases are only a few of the common natural features.
Ruins of past civilizations and fortresses lie scattered among the fantastic
natural rock formations. 
The Thorax Tower is just one of many inhabited ruins. This 80-foot-tall
tower stands near the gorge opening of the caldera. The fluted tower’s walls
resemble dozens of large vertical backbones connected by corrugated ribs.
Windows carved in the likeness of grinning skulls signify each of the four
levels. A blind elf stands guard to the side of a gated entrance. With his
eye sockets sewn shut, the elf listens for visitors with his acute hearing.
He holds a bronze mallet and wears bronze mail resembling snake skin.
A bronze gong with the relief of a wolf hangs from a stand beside him.
He rings the gong every round as soon as he hears visitors approaching.
The gong summons a grimlek each round he hammers away at the bronze
disk (maximum of 4). Another can materialize once one is slain. The
grimleks serve Chaotic beings who sound the gong. The wolf-like demons
materialize from the emblazoned wolf image. The grimleks vanish once
the gong stops reverberating (usually within 5d4 rounds). They remain as
long as the gong sounds.
The elf, Elucith, serves as a reluctant guard for the tower’s current
queen, Maliza (a medusa with sorceress powers). While not inherently
evil, Elucith obeys Maliza to the best of his ability. She holds his wife
prisoner (stoned) within the tower.

Mud Island Pyramid

The stench of sulfur rolls from this cavernous chamber. Great blisters
of ruddy mud burst, releasing putrid gas across the soupy lake. Narrow
rock paths wind through the lake of boiling mud. The paths crisscross
throughout the room. They all end at a large flat island near the cavern’s
center. Blubbery men seemingly made of mud dredge human skulls from
the lake. The mud men (actually 12 lemures covered in mud) bring
countless skulls up from the lake’s depths and stack them into a 30-foottall pyramid. The red mud stains the skulls a pale burgundy. The lemurs
use a mash of bile and clay to cement the skulls together.
The lemures are building a shrine to Tsathogga in this mud-ridden
caldera. The lemures largely ignore intruders but attack under the orders
of their commander. Hiding just under the surface of the mud lake lurks
their hezrou master. The hezrou explodes out of the mud to attack any
magic--users. The hezrou is charged with establishing a new shrine to the
demon frog.

Khavorr demons are considered to be a third-category demon, although
they are unrelated to the more commonly summoned Glabrezu type. They
resemble grossly fat humans, or perhaps giants, for they stand 10ft in
height. A Khavorr demon has the head of an alligator, and these powerful
jaws are a terrible weapon.
Khavorrs take only half damage from electricity, cold, fire, and poison
gas. They are able to cast darkness in a radius of 15ft at will, and to teleport
once per day. In addition, they have the ability to detect invisibility, cause
fear (as per a wand), and to telekinese 300 pounds of weight, any of these
abilities being employed at will. Khavorrs can polymorph themselves into
massive alligators or into a human shape, and can cast charm monster 3
times per day.
Khavorr demons can be damaged by normal weapons. A Khavorr demon
can attempt to gate in another demon with a 30% chance of success. The
demon appearing may be of Category 1, 2, or 3 (roll 1d3 to determine).

The Flesh Peddler

In the darkest recesses of the Canal District of Bard’s Gate mopes the
drunkard, Delmar the Glassblower. Delmar, a very successful glass artist,
traveled to city with his beautiful young bride to set up shop. Just a week
after their arrival, however, Sonie left him to pursue a life of prostitution.
Delmar pleads with anyone with a formidable appearance to help him
retrieve his wife. He insists that Sonie would not make such a choice
willingly. He believes she is under a spell or perhaps was forced into her
sundry occupation. He has little to offer adventurers aside from supplying
glassware at wholesale cost.
He tells heroes that Sonie works at Manky Mary’s Alehouse. He
describes a blubbery man with a wide evil smile who peddles her out
like a common trinket. Indeed, Sonie has fallen under the charm of a
khavor demon. The khavor, known as Gastro the Greased, has charmed
a dozen comely humans into submission. The demon takes the form of
a grotesquely obese human male with exaggerated features. The demon
takes great pleasure in despoiling and corrupting societies’ chaste. He
revels in destroying the bliss of young love. He loiters in the gloomy
recesses of the alehouse, surrounded by a charmed entourage. A massive
table of food always sits before him. He greedily devours everything
Mary feeds him. While she does not care for Gastro, she readily accepts
his abundance of coin. She ran out of food long ago and sends her servants
into the streets to scrounge for anything to present to Gastro. Currently,
she serves putrid goat roast, rat soup (with a touch of lamp oil for flavor)
and hash made from the garbage of neighboring taverns.

The Laravaxu are a second form of Second-Category Demon demon existing in the depths
of the abyss in addition to the better-documented Hezrou form. Laravaxu
take half damage from electricity, cold, fire, and poison gas. They are able
to cast darkness in a radius of 15ft at will, and to teleport twice per day.
In addition, they have the ability to detect invisibility, cause fear (as per a
wand), and to telekinese 200 pounds of weight, each usable at will.
Laravaxu have the form of a massive, slimy grub with a huge mouth.
They cannot be damaged with blunt weapons, but normal piercing or
cutting weapons will damage them. The Laravaxu’s only attack is its bite,
but if the demon rolls a natural 19 or 20 on its to-hit roll, the opponent
has been swallowed whole. Any creature swallowed by the demon will
be turned into a demonic larva within 1d3+5 melee rounds unless the
Laravaxu is killed.
A Laravaxu demon has the ability to gate in another Category 2 demon
(20% chance of success). When a Laravaxu successfully gates in another
demon, there is a 50% chance that the summoned demon will be a Hezrou
and a 50% chance that it will be another Laravaxu. If several demons end
up being summoned into the battle, if the Hezrou outnumber the Laravaxu
by 2:1 or more, the Hezrou will fall upon the Laravaxu and attempt to kill
them.

The Piper

The Pipe Cleaners Union of Bard’s Gate is on strike. Despite the direct
request to return to work by Tunnel Foreman Gorbit Ashenchisel,
the union refuses to comply. The union workers claim that a week ago,
they noticed that the sewer rats disappeared entirely. Soon after the rats
vanished, workers stopped returning from assignments in the Canal
District. The magistrate has offered a 1,000 gp reward for anyone who
solves the mystery so the workers can return to their vital tasks.
Exploring the sewers at this time proves a difficult task. Due to the lack of
pipe cleaners and scavenging rats, the sewage is backing up. Clogged pipes
and fermenting waste fill the sewer drains, backing up the stagnant waters.
Standing waste water pools in the tunnels. The system remains eerily quiet
without the flowing sewer or the chattering of warm-blooded vermin.
Large maggots and grubs wriggle in the mold-encrusted waste filling
the canal. Infesting the island of rancid feces are 2d6 lemure demons that
wriggle slug-like around a central floating block of waste. A gold idol of a
bloated demonic figure playing a silver flute (2,100 gp) sits half-buried in
the muck. If the flute is cleaned and played, it heals 1d6 points of damage
to anyone hearing it once per day.
In a central sewage exchange chamber under the massive blockage,
lives a laravaxu demon. The demon curls up in a bend in the sewer pipes,
and drags its bulk out to attack anyone disturbing the island.

Dough Boys

A towering chimney is the most prominent feature of this large brick
building. Heavenly aromas of baked pastries, sweet breads and other
delicacies fill the air. A large silhouette of a huge cupcake hangs above
the door. Nootbar Tallet inherited the bakery from generations of Tallets
before him. His heart is not quite into baking as a living, however, so
he dabbles in black magic. He uses his spell-crafting talents to enhance
and create his confectionary masterpieces. His pastries are highly sought
after by the wealthy and nobility alike. In his greed, he has relied more on
magic than his skill or legendary family recipes.
Nootbar has a problem. In order to cut costs of labor he summoned
2 lemures to work the ovens and perform menial tasks. Unfortunately,
the lemures’ evil dispositions and low intelligence make them poor
servants. The resulting baked goods do not stand up to the Tallet family’s
reputation. Sickened clients, foul tastes and unsavory appearance led to
a decline in business and income. Now, the flour-covered lemures refuse
to leave and Nootbar cannot talk his employees into working alongside
the pasty lemures. The lemures continue to bake, wielding giant wooden
spatulas and oven forks. The doughy lemures wear chef hats, all the while
laughing at the mayhem going on around them.

A Sea of Hands

A smooth rock landing overlooks an unfathomable scene. Several iron,
canoe-like boats sit adjacent to the entrance. Iron barbs and rusty blades
adorn the boats’ exteriors. Whips, tridents and tri-bladed spears lie in the
bottom of the boats. The depth of the floor of this massive chamber cannot
easily be determined. Thousands of grey hands reach upward from the
mass of tightly packed manes demons filling the lower reaches of the
room. Their grasping hands sit level with the entry floor. Every so often
a manes manages to escape from the mass and attempts to flee only to be
pulled back down into the grasping horde.
Several exits line the far side of the chamber. A glabrezu charges from
one of the portals across the lake of hands. The manes’ hands meet each
step of the glabrezu, supporting its weight as if it were walking on solid
ground. Any evil being can walk upon the manes without hindrance. Those
of non-evil alignment are pulled under and torn apart by the countless
manes. The manes carry any creatures within the boats on command. One
simply has to state what direction and speed for the manes to safely carry
boat riders. The manes scream in agony as the boats rip through their
hands and heads. Regardless of the pain, they obediently move the boats
over the mass. The manes can surprisingly pass the boats along above
their heads as fast as a horse can run.

Sphere

This chamber once contained an evil artifact of immense power forged
in the bowels of Hell. Its presence on this world acted as a parasite to all
that is good and holy. A bulging iron door blocks entry into this chamber.
The iron door has melted into a single unmovable sheet of iron welded to
the frame. A titanic chamber lies in ruin behind the solid door. Scorched
and scared, the room’s surfaces tell the story of a horrific battle. Dusty
bones, corroded weapons and pieces of armor cover the floor. The remains
of men and demons lie mingled in heaps where they perished in battle. Fat
pillars uphold the lofty ceiling and obscure vision across the expansive
chamber. A harsh light from the depths of the chamber casts deep shadows
across the floor. Toward the back of the lightless chamber sits a 20-footdiameter sphere of iridescent radiance. The scene inside the sphere is
drastically different than the room’s contents.
Within the sphere, a woman leaps into the air to grasp a ring floating
in front of her. Dressed in white leather, the human woman bears an
expression of desperation and terror. A man in archaic robes lies on the
floor under her. A gigantic iron trident pins him through his chest to the
floor. Despite this mortal wound, he shouts something at the woman.
Behind the woman stands a vrock demon also frozen in time. The vrock
appears to chase the woman with a barbed two-handed sword ready to
cleave her in two. Amazingly, the creatures with the sphere appear to
move in painfully slow motion. The entire scene takes about 10 minutes
to play out before the sphere briefly blinks out and repeats the moment.
In actuality, the scene only covers about 2 seconds of time. The sphere is
a corrupted time stop spell that has gone horribly wrong. Those trapped
within are bound in a time loop that repeats unendingly. With his last
breath, the wizard impaled on the ground finished the spell but the demonic
trident tainted the incantation. A perceptive observer may determine that
the wizard’s last word was “stop.”
The woman grasps at a ring of wishes (also tainted by the demonic
presence). Her wish, which is prevented from fulfillment, was to become
powerful enough to stop the demonic horde. Only the vrock survived
among the countless demons that once guarded the room. Disturbing any
of the sphere’s prisoners breaks the time stop. Once the spell ends, the
woman in white transforms into a marilith complete with six sabers in
fulfillment of her wish. As a marilith, her demonic mind takes over and
she attacks. Realizing her power, the vrock immediately sides with the
marilith. There is one wish remaining on the ring the marilith wears. The
dead mage wears magical robes that absorb blows from blunt weapons
(AC equal to plate mail versus blunt attacks only). The woman returns
to human form if slain or after 24 hours elapse. She is a 12th-level thief.

The Forgotten Garden

High in the Hollow Spire Mountains stands a tropical garden surrounded
by a low rock wall. Located above the tree line, the garden has a balmy
humid environment. Snow piles up along the outside of the wall but not
within the garden. No barrier is visible. An unfinished stone arch marks
the entrance. A symbol of discord etched in stone serves as a keystone. The
garden holds unfamiliar giant flowers that grow along the ground amid
giant fern-like leaves. A single colorful egg sits in each flower’s center.
The eggs belong to a race of faerie folk. Long ago, a faerie king defeated a
nalfeshnee demon in an epic battle. As result of its defeat, the nalfeshnee
was forced to serves as guard for 1,000 years.
The nalfeshnee takes the form of a splendid and stunningly female fairy
slightly shorter than an elf. The nalfeshnee must stay on the outside of the
garden wall and serves to the best of its abilities to protect the garden and
faerie folk. Despite its evil nature, the nalfeshnee does not mind serving
the fickle faerie folk.

Wild Child

Wild roars of triumph and revelry blast from this small orc settlement.
Screams of pain intermingle with the raucous merriment. The 24 orcs that
make up the Black Bone Tribe celebrate around a fire pit. Another 2 dozen
orcs lie in tents too sick to move. A young orc girl struggles against chain
bindings her to a spit over the fire pit. She screams in terror and pain. The
orcish youngling is a recent addition to the tribe (after rescuing her from
a local prison wagon). The girl (called Shrawg) is actually a polymorphed
quasit. Its other form is that of a horned lizard. Shrawg wears a ring of fire
resistance around its tail and feigns agony above the flames.
These downtrodden orcs have had a run of recent bad luck. Their food
disappeared, horses ran off, bow strings snapped, etc… With half their
tribe immobilized by sickness (quasit poison), the orcs believe themselves
to be cursed. They blame (and rightfully so) Shrawg. Shrawg thanks
rescuers and promises servitude.

Shaazavi demons are a fourth-category demon with three vulture-like
heads, a human torso, and the legs of a goat.
Shaazavis take only half damage from electricity, cold, fire, and poison
gas. They are able to cast darkness in a radius of 15ft at will, and to teleport
once per day. In addition, they have the ability to detect invisibility, cause
fear (as per a wand), and to telekinese 300 pounds of weight, any of these
abilities being employed at will. Shazavis can polymorph themselves, and
can cast charm monster 3 times per day.
In addition, each head of a Shaazavi demon can employ a breath
weapon, although these cannot all be brought to bear in the same direction
at one time, each head “covering” a 120-degree angle around the demon.
One of the heads can spit a line of acid similar to that of a black dragon;
the second head breathes a cone of fire as a red dragon, and the third
head exhales a cloud of gas similar to that of a green dragon. Each breath
weapon inflicts 5d6 points of damage, with a successful saving throw
indicating half damage.
Shaazavi demons cannot be damaged by normal weapons; magic
weapons are required to damage them. A Shaazavi demon can attempt
to gate in another demon with a 60% chance of success. The demon
appearing may be of Category 1, 2, 3, or 4 (roll 1d4 to determine type).
Most Shaazavis have individual names.

When the Bell Tolls

In the center of the large brewing community of Alement stands
a 20-foot-tall monument carved from granite. On the north face of the
obelisk is a large six-foot-tall bronze visage of a satyr. The satyr wears
an expression of joy. Its wide grinning mouth is agape. The open mouth
extends into the obelisk about an arm’s length. A 30-foot-wide band of
solid stone flush with the ground surrounds the base. Numbers, algorithms
and celestial designs set in bronze adorn the ring of stone. Atop the 8-footwide obelisk sits a wide bronze arrow. Glass orbs of varying colors bisect
the arrow, allowing light to travel through the exquisite bronze casting.
The arrow acts as a sundial to the numeric figures and symbols below. The
timepiece also works at night by magically absorbing light from stars and
other celestial bodies. Scholars and soothsayers from around the region
speculate on the origin and purpose of this relic from ancient times.
During solstices or other astronomical phenomena, the timepiece
shimmers with magical light and a resounding gong issues from within
the stone. During this time, gold coins (usually 10d10 x10), fine ale,
10d10 random gems (10 gp each) or other blessings pour forth from the
satyr’s gaping mouth. They place an urn beneath the mouth to collect the
blessings.
The citizens of Alement are now joyously gathered to celebrate the
upcoming solstice, unaware that a shaavazi demon has spent the past
month corrupting the obelisk. As the men and women dance merrily
around the stone ring, the mouth begins vomiting forth gallons of bile,
fermented ale and the partially digested remains of a satyr. Anyone near
the stone must make a saving throw or be overcome with nausea at the
horrible smell that issues from the stone. As the townsfolk are emptying
their stomachs, a shaavazi demon appears in a massive cloud of putrid
smoke and pyrotechnics atop the timepiece. The demon vicious attacks all
in the area. The demon remains until the sun rises.

Birds of a Feather

On the rocky cliffs bordering the Hollow Spire Mountains sits a ruined
temple of Pazuzu, demon lord of the winds. A harrowing climb leads PCs
to the temple sitting atop a thick column of granite. The outer temple is
little more than a small ziggurat carved into the top of the column. The
only entrance appears to be filled with seamless stone. Paladins ransacked
the temple decades ago and filled the entrance with a wall of stone to seal
off any evil lingering within the depths.
Winged demons made of the same seamless stone stand atop the temple’s
crown, each facing one of the Cardinal directions. The effigies surround
a 10-foot-diameter hole that descends 50 feet where a magical stone floor
seals the pit. Each stone statue points to the horizon with a clawed talon. A
whistling scream resonates from each gaping maw as living creatures pass
before the statue. While evil lies imprisoned below, cultist and followers
of Pazuzu still pay homage to the dark god in the outer temple. Skulking
around the ziggurat are 2d4 gargoyles. In addition, Pazuzu commissioned
a large and unusually cunning vrock to re-establish the temple. Thus far,
the vrock has been able to breach the stone walls. It waits to see if PCs
break through the stone, then ambushes them in the temple entrance to
keep them from polluting the temple grounds.

Yildra demons are servitors of Yildraathu, the Demon-Lord of
Pestilence, and as such they are not considered to be a general demonic
“type.” The Yildra take the form of massive rats standing on their hind
legs, their fur crawling with vermin and their skin mottled with rot and
mange. The demon’s long tail bears a wicked barb at the end, and their
claws drip with foul ichor.
The claws of a Yildra carry disease, and the barb on the demon’s tail
carries a lethal poison. The diseased claws have the immediate effect (if a
saving throw fails) of causing the diseased victim to move at half speed as
if affected by a slow spell, and the disease will eventually cause death in
2d6 days if it is not magically cured.
Yildras take only half damage from electricity, cold, fire, and poison
gas. They are able to cast darkness in a radius of 15ft at will, and to teleport
once per day. In addition, they have the ability to detect invisibility, cause
fear (as per a wand), and to telekinese 300 pounds of weight, any of these
abilities being employed at will. Yildras can attempt to summon another
Yildra demon, but this can be attempted only once per day and has only a
10% chance of success.
Yildras can be hit with normal weapons, but such weapons have a
penalty of -1 to hit and damage against the demon.

Rat Stink

The small prison known as Bastion Evince is known throughout the
land as a prison for those committing minor infractions. The prison
sits on a rock island in the midst of a large man-made lake. A floating
bridge connects the towering prison with the mainland. As a labor camp,
prisoners are taken to the adjacent quarries to mine limestone blocks for
foundations throughout the land. Prisoners’ crimes range from petty theft
to tax evasion. The hard labor usually detours repeat offenders.
Endrad arrives every morning to lead prisoners in prayer (to Freya),
comfort the dying, and cure the sick. The conditions in Bastion Evince
have worsened over the past year. Despite steps taken by the warden,
guards and the visiting cleric, prisoners constantly contract diseases.
Plague-ridden fleas and rats swarm to the deteriorating jail.
During a recent morning prayer, a yildra demon arrived to slay
Joandolar and bring death and pestilence to the prison. The yildra
manifested inside the temple and began slaughtering prisoners and guards
alike as it tried to reach Joandolar. Guards and prisoners alike fled the
prison. While some escaped, many others are still chained and shackled
together in the main room. The guards have their hands full trying to
restore order and can’t stop to find missing prisoners.
While the upper prison remains clean, the lower halls and cells are
filled with corpses and swarms of rats. Adding to the misery, diseasecarrying fleas, skin mites and mosquito swarms buzz throughout the
prison. Joandolar locked himself in a cell deep within the compound. He
is safe, but the yildra waits patiently for Joandolar to attempt to escape. It
deals violently with any rescuers sent to retrieve the priest.

Isclaadra is a tall, human-like figure with the horns and legs of a goat,
and massive bat wings. He is one of the weakest of the demon princes, and
he is uncharacteristically subtle when compared to his peers. He has the
spell-casting ability of an 8th level magic-user in addition to the powers
described below, and can only be hit by weapons of +2 or greater.
At will, Isclaadra can cast charm monster, clairvoyance, continual
darkness, dispel magic, ESP, fear, read languages, read magic, telekinesis
(1,000 pounds of weight), and suggestion.
Isclaadra’s Staff of Mist is a powerful magic artifact, allowing the
holder to enter gaseous form at will, and capable of summoning forth one
of three types of mist (each once per day):
Mist of Magic Absorption: this mist can be streamed forth from the
staff up to a distance of 100ft before it expands. Once it blossoms into a
cloud, it eats magic in an area 50ft in diameter, temporarily removing all
bonuses or other effects from magic items while they are in the mist. The
power of the mist does not extend to powerful artifacts, but is enough to
suppress magical swords, armor, and miscellaneous items. Spells cannot
be cast within the mist, but the effects of a spell that has already been cast
(e.g. invisibility or haste) are unaffected by the mist, and potions will also
take effect if imbibed in the mist. The holder of the staff can cause the
mist to creep in any direction, but it has a move of only 10ft. Its duration

Mist of Confusion: the range, size, move, and duration of the Mist of
Confusion are all identical to those of the Mist of Magic Absorption. Its
effect is that of a confusion spell.
Mist of Striking: The Mist of Striking is a thin ribbon of vapor that
extends from the staff up to a length of 100ft. It can attack once per round
as a 30HD monster, inflicting 2d6 points of damage. Other than by dispel
magic against a 12th level caster, the Mist of Striking cannot be killed,
although it will disappear after 5d6 turns.

Harbor Mist

The coastal town of Niborlyn recently experienced a handful of
misfortunes, but their most recent hardship brought them to the edge of
oblivion. A massive fog bank moved over the town, cutting off all visible
access to the fishing settlement. The fog severely limits visibility, allowing
only a few feet of sight. Even magically enhanced vision falters in the
thick, churning fog. The fog bank surrounds the town and stretches about
half a mile wide. The fog lightens within the town’s boundaries, allows
visibility for about 20 feet. Winds don’t disperse the cloud, and the fog
defies nature. In fact, the winds blowing off the sea can’t budge the mist.
All attempts to breach the surrounding fog have failed; allips, wraiths
and spectres lurk within the fog, taking full advantage of the concealment.
Each round spent in the fog has a 2 in 6 chance of attracting the undead.
In addition, several gigantic crabs and hordes of giant sea spiders
scuttle through the fog. The undead leave the vermin alone. Sensing
the impending doom of the community, a kraken sits just off the coast,
grabbing those who attempt to escape by water.
The Demon Prince Isclaadra floats on a column of billowing vapor
above the town’s well. Furthermore, a khryll hides in the well, ready to
protect Isclaadra. The demon prince arrived several days ago and slew the
town’s militia. Isclaadra demands the willing hand of Ceila Cregzyn in
matrimony. Ceila, the virginal, young adult daughter of a single mother,
hides within her home. She is the bastard child of Commander Shallatin
Green, a paladin in the great northern fortress of Shieldfane. The paladin
cross Isclaadra nearly a year ago, and the demon prince spent the time
seeking out a way to bring down the haughty warrior. Isclaadra has his
own twisted reasons for wanting to marry the girl, but it all leads to
destroying the knight. The marriage must have Ceila’s compliance and be
performed by a righteous priest of sanctity. Ceila’s mother screams for aid
against the demon.

Demon Lord, Kharkazax (Prince of Carrion)
Hit Dice: 30 (120 hit points)
Armor Class: -6 [25]
Attacks: 2 claws (2d8), 1 bite (4d8)
Saving Throw: 3
Special: Magic resistance (70%), +3 or better weapon to hit,
also see below
Move: 9/12 (flying)
Alignment: Chaos
Challenge Level/XP: 38/9,800
Kharkazax resembles a humanoid jackal with the wings and head
of a vulture, and he is always accompanied by 6 vrock-type demons
of maximum hit points. This demon-lord is known as the Prince of
Carrion, for his followers are scavengers and carrion-eaters of all kinds,
including, unpleasantly, his human cultists. Although he is brilliant and
subtle, Kharkazax is more feral in combat than most demon princes; if
he is forced into melee combat he will tear into his foes with beak and
claws rather than using weapons. Any creature other than a demon coming
within 50ft of him will be affected by his smell, as if by a slow spell (no
saving throw). His bite is diseased, causing death within 1d4+1 rounds if
the rapid course of the disease is not checked (if a saving throw succeeds,
the disease merely causes 1d4 points of damage each round, for 1d4+1
rounds, but does not kill).
At will, Kharkazax can cast charm monster, clairvoyance, continual
darkness, dispel magic, ESP, fear, read languages, read magic, telekinesis
(1,000 pounds of weight), and suggestion. Once per day, Kharkazax can create
a wall of vermin, a mass of roaches and centipedes that rises 40ft in height
and 100ft in length, or forms a covered dome thirty feet across and twenty
feet in height. The biting creatures in the wall automatically inflict 2d10+20
points of damage against anyone breaking through it, and 1d10 hit points per
round against anyone trying to attack it with a melee weapon. The wall is armor
class 8, and has 100 hit points. Kharkazax can see through the eyes of his wallvermin, and cast spells from the wall as if he were standing within it, but for all
others the wall blocks vision and cannot be penetrated by spells. Demons take
no damage from passing through the wall unless Kharkazax so desires.
This demon-prince cannot be damaged by weapons of less than +3
enchantment.

Carrion Capacity

A horrible stench expands to fill nearly a mile radius. Largely avoided
by locals, Carrion Knoll is a haven for vultures. Ancient dead trees litter
the hillsides, offering bountiful roosting opportunities for the hundreds of
scavenger birds flocking to this area. During the day, a continual spiral of
vultures lazily encircles the knoll. The burned ruins of a cathedral of Freya
sit atop the knoll’s peak. Only the thick walls and buttresses of the massive
temple remain. Unlike most scavengers, the vultures bring their decaying
meals here to feast. Countless bones and carcasses cover the grounds and
hang from dead tree limbs. Jackals and forest hyenas lurk in the shadows,
yipping and laughing at the approach of strangers. Clouds of flies swarm the
air and hordes of harmless carrion beetles shift under the carcasses. Carrion
Knoll started off innocently enough as the local farmers used the yawning
well atop the knoll as a dumping grounds for diseased livestock and other
refuse. Eventually, the community used the well to dispose of criminals and
other unsavory races that encroached on their livelihood. The ruins finally
fell into the clutches of the demon lord of carrion, Kharkazak, who treats
the entire area as a shrine to his putrescence.
Currently, the former temple of Freya on Carrion Knoll serves as a focal
point for the degenerate cultists of Kharkazak. While cultists often do not linger
on the knoll, there are always 3d6 feral humans devouring rotting carcasses
throughout the wasteland. While the feral humans pose no threat to seasoned
adventures, 2d4 cultists (clerics 2–6 level) maintain and defend the temple
grounds. Recently, a giant vulture delivered the corpse of a titan child. During
a grand ceremony, the carrion lord and 1d4 vrocks joined in a magnificent feast.

Demon Lord, Orcus (Prince of the Undead)
Hit Dice: 30 (125hp)

Challenge Level/XP: 40/10400
Orcus is one of the strongest (if not the strongest) and most powerful of all demon lords. Known as the Prince of the Undead, he fights a
never-ending war against rival demon princes that spans several Abyssal
layers. From his great bone palace he commands his troops as they wage
war across the smoldering and stinking planes of the Abyss. Orcus spends
most of his days in his palace, rarely leaving its confines unless he decides
to leads his troops into battle (which has happened on more than one occasion). Most of the time though, he is content to let his generals and
commanders lead the battles.
Orcus is a squat, bloated humanoid standing 15 feet tall and weighing 3
tons. His goat-like head sports large, spiraling ram-like horns and his legs
are covered in thick brown fur and end in hooves. Two large, black, batlike wings protrude from his back and a long, snake-like tail, tipped with
a sharpened barb, trails behind it.
When not warring against rival demon princes, Orcus likes to travel the
planes, particularly the Material Plane. Should a foolish spellcaster open a
gate and speak his name, he is more than likely going to hear the call and
step through to the Material Plane. What happens to the spellcaster that
called him usually depends on the reason for the summons and the power
of the spellcaster. Extremely powerful spellcasters are usually slain after
a while and turned into undead soldiers or generals in the demon lord’s
armies.

Orcus and Cake

Orcus prefers to fight using his Wand. His tail sting delivers a virulent
poison (save or die). Orcus can command or banish undead as a 15th-level
cleric, controlling up to 150 HD worth of undead at one time. He casts
spells as a 15th level Cleric and 12th level Magic-user, and can use the
following magical abilities at will: animate dead, charm monster, darkness, dispel magic, ESP, fear, feeblemind (1/day), lightning bolt, speak
with dead, symbol (any) and wall of fire.
Orcus radiates a 60-foot-radius aura of fear (as the spell). A creature
in the area must succeed at a saving throw or be affected as though by a
fear spell.
Three times per day, Orcus can summon one balor, 1d3 nalfeshnees or
1d4 mariliths. As their prince, Orcus can summon up to 100 HD of any
type of undead each day.
Wand of Orcus: Mighty Orcus wields a huge, black, skull-tipped rod
that functions as a +3 heavy mace. It slays any living creature it touches
if the target fails a saving throw. Further, the Wand has the following
magical powers: 3/day—animate dead, darkness and fear; 2/day—unholy
word. Orcus occasionally allows his wand to pass into the Material Plane,
usually into the hands of one of his servants.

On the 29th day of the first month, the residents of Covahlam gather
to celebrate the birthday of their beloved leader, King Montague I.
Every year, the royal baker outdoes himself, creating a masterful cake
big enough to feed a kingdom. The 12-foot-tall, tiered cake is nearly 20
feet in diameter. Sugar sculptures celebrating Montague’s life decorate its
edges. His battle with the dread dragon is a highlight along one cake tier,
and his dousing of the elemental fires of Krill is an orange-frosting lover’s
delight. Each year, a new candle holder is added to the magnificent cake
to celebrate the king’s latest birthday. An artist is sought out each year to
design a magnificent holder to outdo last year’s creation.
This year, however, things went horribly wrong. The artist died shortly
after completing this year’s candle holder. The white-and-black creation is
crafted from a dragon’s wing bone and looks like a curling finger pointing
skyward. It has a natural bone spur on the tip that looks like a grinning skull.
When a wax candle is added, the skull’s eyes glow red and smoke rolls from
its mouth. The effect is horrific, but the royal court doesn’t have an option:
The king’s birthday is tonight, and it is too late to find another candle holder.
They hope to hide the candle holder and distract the king and his guests.
What they don’t know is that priests of Orcus killed the artist and
replaced his creation with this wicked artifact bathed in the blood of
hundreds of innocents. The bone candle holder served as the focal
point for their sacrifices for 10 years, all time spent preparing it for this
very moment. When a candle is placed in the holder and lit, powerful
summoning spells poured into the bone over the years are completed. The
candle holder immediately opens a portal for the dread Orcus to enter the
castle’s grand ballroom. The demon-prince erupts out of the cake to slay
the revelers trapped at the party.

Demon Lord, Teratashia (Princess of Dimensions)
Hit Dice: 31 (130 hit points)
Armor Class: -6 [25] or -8 [27]
Attacks: 4 claws (2d6)
Saving Throw: 3
Special: Magic resistance (85%), +2 or better weapon to

necklace of skulls, demonic powers
Move: 12/24 (flying)
Alignment: Chaos
Challenge Level/XP: 42/11,000
The Demon-Princess Teratashia’s dark palace in the depths of the Abyss is
a nexus of countless gaps between dimensions, a warren of tunnels worming
their way deep into a multitude of other realities. From the center of this web
of connections, Teratashia sends her minions creeping and slithering through
the planes of existence to do her bidding. Her darkswimmer demons (q.v.)
are but one of the many types of servitors employed by this horrid creature.
Teratashia resembles a huge, female-headed cockroach with a feral
visage, wearing a necklace of human skulls. This necklace is a powerful
artifact (see, “The Necklace of Skulls,” below). She is often known as
the Mistress of Dimensions, and her servants include many demons and
other creatures that hunt and hide in the dark non-places between the true
planes of existence.
At will, Teratashia can cast charm monster, clairvoyance, continual darkness,
dimension door, dispel magic, ESP, insect swarm (3/day), fear, read languages,
read magic, telekinesis (1,000 pounds of weight), teleport, suggestion, and wall
of stone. In darkness, she regenerates 2 hit points per round, and in the light she
moves with preternatural speed, her armor class improving to -8. Only weapons
with an enchantment of +2 or more can damage her.
Teratashia’s Necklace of Skulls has 25 charges, and recharges itself
within 25 hours (one charge per hour). Each round (until the charges
are expended) the necklace can perform one of the following actions in
addition to Teratashia’s other abilities).
Cone of Cold (3 charges)
Cure the wearer of 2d8 hit points of damage (2 charges)
Darkness 30ft radius (1 charge)
Death spell (5 charges)
Fireball (2 charges)
Knock spell (1 charge)
Wizard lock (1 charge)
Teratashia seldom involves herself in the quarrels of the other great
demons, being far more interested in controlling the nooks and crannies
between dimensions than with her political status in the Abyss.

Dimensional Dementia

The black reflective door to this alien room melts into a mercury-like
substance across the floor as soon as a living creature touches its surface.
The door reforms once a living creature enters the camber beyond or after
1 minute elapses. Once inside the room, the door cannot be opened by
non-magical means, and is as strong as a 10-inch-thick iron slab.
Small, three- and four-sided pyramids cover the floor of this angular
chamber. The 2- to 4-inch-tall shapes seem formed from the floor, making
walking difficult, but not impossible. The walls slope up to a pyramidshaped ceiling. A shaft of light from the apex above illuminates a depthless
rectangle spinning impossibly on one corner in the center of the room.
One side of the rectangle reflects like a highly polished mirror, while the
other absorbs light. The reflected light flashes across the room like an
extraterrestrial lighthouse, causing confusion (save resists) in any living
creature it passes over. The eight-foot-tall rectangle spins more rapidly as
living creatures enter the room. As the mirrored surface accelerates, a darkly
beautiful woman appears in the spinning light and dark pattern of the stone.
The woman stands on a featureless plain and begins to float forward. As
she approaches the rectangle (from the other side), the small pyramids sink
into the floor. As the light passes over the increasingly smooth floor, the fins
of 4 darkswimmer demons break the surface like water. The floor ripples
harmlessly like the wake behind a boat as the fins circle.
This forgotten access point provided a cult of Teratashia access to her
nexus. Living creatures in the chamber immediately draw the attention
of the demon princess Teratashia herself. She arrives in 2d4 rounds
to ensure no one enters her nexus via this conduit. The portal leads to
nightmarish catacombs that serve as her palace between the layers of
the Abyss. If the whirling portal is damaged, it explodes in an explosive
blast of fire and sulfur (10d6 points of damage, save for half) releasing
Teratashia and an additional 1d4 darkswimmers. Those entering the
portal find themselves trapped with no obvious way to return.

Demon Lord, Thalasskoptis (The Sea-Demon Lord)

Attacks: 8 tentacles (2d8)
Saving Throw: 3
Special: Magic resistance 90%, also see below
Move: 12/24 (swimming)
Alignment: Chaos
Challenge Level/XP: 39/10,100
Thalasskoptis is a mass of writhing tentacles with a feral, boyish face
in the center. It is a powerful demon-prince that makes its lair in the deep,
dark seas of the Abyss, living in a sprawling palace of coral that dives
into deep subterranean tunnels beneath the sea floor. Thalasskoptis is the
lord of underwater corruption, the sea-dead, and many horrific beasts of
the dark, oceanic deeps. It is an occasional rival with Orcus, given that its
rulership of the sea-undead conflicts with the broader claims of the other
demon-prince, but the two demons are similar enough that they are allies
more frequently than enemies in the grim power struggles of the Abyssal
realms. Some rivals of Thalasskoptis even dismiss it as the underwater
minion of Orcus, a claim which is likely to incur a terrible vengeance from
the sea-demon.
Beyond the realms of the Abyss, Thalasskoptis has scattered followings
of human cultists, predominantly in coastal communities, and in the deeps
he is served by dark tritons (q.v.). From time to time, his dark ships of
drowned, undead sailors will rise from the waters to pillage treasure for
their dread lord; one reason why his human cults are not attacked or driven
off is the potential for reprisal by these ships. When the black fleets rise
from the water, reeking of salt and rot, miles of coastline can be purged of
life by hordes of Thalasskoptis’s dead men, the inhabitants dragged down
beneath the waves to serve the master they dismissed with insufficient
fear.
At will, Thalasskoptis can cast animate dead, charm monster,
clairvoyance, continual darkness, dispel magic, ESP, fear, read languages,
read magic, telekinesis (1,000 pounds of weight), teleport, suggestion, and
wall of stone. Three times per day, the demon-prince can also squirt a vast
cloud of poisonous ink into the air or water, with twice the dimensions of a
fireball. Anyone in the area of the cloud must make a saving throw against
this poison or die. Anyone looking directly at the demon must also make
a saving throw each round or become entranced for 1d4+3 melee rounds,
unable to take any actions until the fascination has ended. Thalasskoptis
cannot be damaged by any weapon with less than a +3 enchantment.

Death Sea

300-foot-diameter sphere made of dead humanoid bodies sewn together
with seaweed. The sphere of bodies has a single opening that tumbles
and spins as the ball of bloated corpses moves with the currents. Clinging
weeds from above keep the sphere anchored in one spot beneath the
floating Sargasso.
The demon-prince rises out of his corpse lair to attack anyone taking
the long sword. He is accompanied by 6 giant sharks, an undead kraken
and a pack of 2d6 aquatic ghouls.

The smell of death drifts across the Reaping Sea, a horrible stench of
decaying bodies rising on the winds blowing over the waves. A Sargasso
of gray algae floats in the water. Hundreds of dead and decaying bodies
are tangled in the pulp of weeds. A dead sperm whale also floats belly up
in the mass, its blubber an ugly ashen color. PCs also find dolphins, a giant
seahorse and hundreds of normal crabs. All of the creatures are dead.
Sitting in the center of the floating field of death is a giant clam shell that
is propped open with a gleaming silver long sword. A 10-foot-diameter
ring of weakened weeds surrounds the clamshell. Anyone stepping on the
weeds vanishes as they fall straight through the pulpy mass and into the
ocean below the floating isle of death. The weapon is a +2 long sword that
does double damage to aquatic creatures on a roll of a natural 20.

Demon Lord, Yildraathu (Lord of Pestilence)

Special: Magic resistance (60%), +2 weapon to hit, disease,

Alignment: Chaos
Challenge Level/XP: 40/10,400
Yildraathu is a large, bubbling pool of viscous ichor, with tentacles
constantly emerging from and sucking back into the horrid mass of the
demon-lord’s “body.”
At will, Yildraathu can cast charm monster, clairvoyance, continual
darkness, dispel magic, ESP, fear, read languages, read magic, telekinesis
(1,000 pounds of weight), and suggestion.
If Yildaathu hits an opponent, the opponent must succeed in a saving throw
or be afflicted by a disease. This disease, Yildaathu’s Plague, immediately
causes the loss of 1d6 hit points in addition to the damage caused by the
tentacle itself, and the disease may cause death within 3 rounds (a second
saving throw is allowed to avoid death). Even if the victim survives, if a cure
disease spell is not used to prevent further infection then death will result in
1d4+3 days. A character who has been hit by a tentacle and succeeds with the
initial saving throw is not immune to the disease, but each time that a saving
throw is made against the disease a bonus of +1 (cumulative) is gained on
saving throws made against infection or death from infection.
Three times per day, Yildraathu can breathe forth a cone-shaped blast
of pestilence 100ft long and expanding to 60ft in width. Anything in this
cloud must make as saving throw against the poisonous breath or suffer
the loss of 6d6 hit points of damage, in addition to paralysis for 3 rounds.
Success on the saving throw indicates that only half damage is taken and
that the paralysis is avoided.
Yildraathu can only be damaged by weapons with an enchantment of
+2 or greater.
The yildra demons (q.v.) are particularly associated with Yildraathu,
and are summoned from time to time by Yildraathic cults, but the demonlord is also served by a number of other demon types.

Pestilence

Streams of smoke and spiraling flocks of vultures can be seen from miles
away over a war-torn battlefield spreading across the plains as far as the
eye can see. The thousands of dead hobgoblins and humans lying on the
fields appear weeks old, and no clear victor can be determined in the epic
battle. Large fires smolder where the deceased were burned. Roaming the
battlefield are 2d4 packs of 3d4 ghouls that devour the recently fallen. A
group of 18 evil highwaymen (bandits) also pillage the dead. They pile the
looted plunder on ox-drawn carts. Packs of rabid dogs, swarms of diseased
rats and other loathsome scavengers roam the wasteland of decay.
On the peak of a low hill, a group of 7 diseased Yildraathu cultists
(4 Clerics 5; 2 Clerics 7; 1 cleric 10) hold a vigil around a crude pool of
collected gore. The ritual is designed to summon a host of plague zombies
from the dead soldiers. Once completed, the 10d10 zombies rise that can
transmit a rapid and deadly disease that turns corpses into zombies. If the
ceremony is interrupted, an angered Yildraathu rises from the pool of gore
to exact his wrath. He gates 4 yildra demons in when he arrives. The yildra
coalesce inside the bloated corpses on nearby horses, then burst forth and
attack. The cultists have collected 1d10 x 100 gold pieces in random coins.

Demon-stirges are the result of magical experimentations with infusing
demonic ichor into the bodies of stirges, then breeding the tainted
creatures. The result of these experiments, often attributed to the mage
Sacavious of the Black Monastery, is a diseased creature more durable
and cunning than a natural stirge. A demon-stirge can cast darkness 15ft
radius once per day, and there is a 10% chance that with a successful hit,
it will infect the character with a disease that will be fatal in 1d4+7 days.
Like a normal stirge, demon-stirges have a proboscis which they jab
into their prey to drain blood. After a stirge’s first hit, it drains blood
automatically at a rate of 1d6 hit points per round. The faster rate of blooddraining is due to barbs and ridges on the proboscis; pulling a dead demonstirge out of a wound will inflict one last hit point of damage simply from
ripping out the barbed tube.

Bats in the Belfry

The ruins of a large cathedral dominate this ruined town. Known on
ancient maps as Vaintuel, this large town was founded around the worship
of Arden. History does not state what happened to the people or the
settlement, but the town now lies devastated. Only the massive stone
framework of the bell tower and the partial remains of the church remain
intact. A mongrelman named Furgl lurks in the heights of the bell tower.
Demonic blood runs thick through Furgl’s hunched body. In fact,
his twisted and diabolical form provides him with immunity to fire
and poisons. Furgl’s hellish blood has many abilities. It has horribly
transformed a swarm of stirges living in the bell tower. Furgl has the legs
and feet of a goat, the upper torso of an obese human and vestigial horn
on his forehead. Furthermore, Furgl has a hump on his upper back. The
sentient hump has a twisted but human-like face. Furgl’s hump is named
Keith. While Keith has no powers other than speech, it constantly belittles
and bullies Furgl and anyone it encounters.
While Furgl has good intentions, his low intelligence often countermands
his actions.
Furgl begins ringing the church bell to warn visitors of a nest of 6
demon-stirges that inhabits the tower. The ringing bell awakens the
demon-stirges while Keith hurls insults at the approaching heroes. Due
to the blood connection, the demon-stirges ally themselves with Furgl and
attack all others.

The demon-wolves of Braazz are creatures from another plane of
existence than can be summoned forth by use of forbidden tomes and
sorcerous rituals. In their normal shape, they resemble grey-skinned
demons with hideous wolf-like faces and the legs and tail of a wolf (the
rest of the body being gaunt but human). They are also, however, shapechangers, and can take on the appearance of wolves with twisted human
faces.
The Wolves of Braazz can only be hit by a magic weapon, although
they do not have any magic resistance to spells. They have certain other
supernatural abilities as well: they can blink once per day (teleporting to a
random location within 30ft, usually just after attacking or after becoming
invisible), they can turn invisible three times per day at will, and they can
charm any creature meeting their gaze (although they can maintain this
charm over only one creature at a time).

Huntress

A massive wooden lodge sits on the forested hillside. The lodge
resembles more of a fort than a cabin. Skins of cave bear, giant elk and
mammoths lie on stretching racks. Giant primeval skulls hang from the
roof. A thick coating of rotting animal hair covers the ground. A boiling
vat of rendered fat spills a thick sludge into the fire below. The noxious oil
smoke clings to everything, leaving a gritty slick residue.
The hill giant huntress Asul Gul stalks the land searching for prey.
Large even for a hill giant, she carries a tree-sized spear and a ballista
when she hunts. Asul Gul has trained a pack of 5 worgs to track quarry.
She also adopted a small ugly wolf that leads her pack. The wolf is
actually a demon-wolf of Braazz that has found this relationship to its
liking. In fact, the demon-wolf serves as the brains and true leader of the
hunters. Summoned by a wizard long ago (it ate the careless spellcaster),
the demon-wolf has terrorized the lands ever since.

A demonvessel is a corpse that has been animated by trapping the
essence of a demon within the body rather than relying on the more basic
necromantic means of animating corpses. Depending upon the exact
method used to bind the demon into a dead corpse, these undead creatures
usually resemble mummies, but in some cases they will appear to be
zombies with strange runes tattooed into the skin. These undead do not
have any particularly unusual attacks, but their minor magic resistance,
immunity to normal weapons, and demonic immunities (see below) make
them dangerous opponents, particularly when they are commanding
numbers of lesser undead. A demonvessel is turned as a vampire, and is
affected by protection from evil spells.
Demonvessels take only half damage from lightning, fire, and cold,
and they are unaffected by charm and sleep magic. They have the ability
to take permanent control of any non-intelligent undead within speaking
distance, and can charm ghouls (although the ghoul would be allowed
a saving throw). For this reason, demonvessels are often found leading
packs or even small hordes of such lesser undead. Demonvessels are no
more intelligent than the demon imprisoned within, so there is a certain
amount of variation: many are little more intelligent than ghouls, but some
of them are quite crafty and subtle, capable of long range planning and
unexpectedly devious thinking.
Most demonvessels will be encountered with a band of 2d4 skeletons,
2d4 zombies, 1d6 ghouls, and 1d2-1 ghasts. These undead are all turned
as vampires while under the command of the demonvessel.

Since his wife’s natural death, the successful lamp merchant Garrick
has wallowed in self-pity. He offered his vast fortune to anyone who could
bring Corliss back to life. Unfortunately, the gods deemed her time had
come and resurrection lies beyond mortal magic. A priestess of Orcus
(under the guise of a cleric of Freya) named Edlyn (Cleric 8) approached
Garrick with empty promises.
Edlyn indeed brought Corliss back from death. Her body, infused
with a demonic spirit, became a demonvessel. Since her transformation,
Garrick’s life has spiraled into a horrific nightmare. Blinded by his
boundless love for his wife, Garrick truly believes that she can be cured.
The elder Garrick has become feral and irrational from the suffering
Vorliss has inflicted upon his already weakened mind. Corliss enjoys
tormenting the crazed man and has thus far resisted the temptation to turn
him into one of her minions. Garrick is prone to violent acts if he feels his
wife is threatened.

The eerie Men of Leng travel the universe from their strange homeland,
always disguising themselves as humans in loose-fitting robes, with
wrappings about the head and face. They are the same size as humans,
but under their disguises they have horned brows, clawed fingers, mouths
full of tentacles, and crooked goatish legs with cloven hooves. Many
scholars have argued over where the otherworldly realm of Leng lies—
some believe it can be found among the Outer Planes, while others are
convinced it can only be reached via a dimension of dreams. The denizens
of Leng can travel to other planes freely, and often do so in strange,
black ships, constantly seeking new breeds of slaves or trading rubies for
unusual services or magical treasures. At other times, their visits are much
more violent, focusing on abducting victims for use as slaves or worse.
On Leng, these denizens have long fought a war against that realm’s
monstrous spiders, a war that sometimes spills over into other worlds.
A Leng denizen’s bite causes lassitude if the victim fails a saving throw
(at -2). Any attack rolls, damage rolls, and saving throws are made at -2
thereafter until the victim has slept continuously for 12 hours. If the same
victim is bitten (and fails the saving throw) a second time, the victim
immediately falls into deep slumber and cannot be awakened for 12 hours.
Additionally, a denizen of Leng is constantly able to read the thoughts of
nearby creatures (ESP) and once per day can cast a mirror image of itself.
The denizens of Leng regenerate naturally if they are not on Leng, at
a rate of 5hp per round. The process cannot be arrested by fire as it can,
for example, with trolls. However, once a denizen reaches 0 hit points,
the body dissolves into slime (and re-forms on Leng). On Leng itself,
denizens do not regenerate, and die completely. Not having souls, they
cannot be raised from the dead.

Howard’s Place

In a small, out of the way back street huddles one of the city’s most
eclectic and sought-after restaurants, known to the locals as Howard’s
Place (no one knows its actual name, if it even has one). A dim, eerie
interior greets patrons, and the local is popular with the well-to-do youth
of the area, who can always be found partaking of the unusual and exotic
menu. The area is surprisingly free of panhandlers and thieves, allowing
the well-to-do free reign to come to the restaurant frequently.
Serving such delicacies as manticore flank and dire rat wings (try them,
they taste like chicken!), “troll-cubes”, 1 in. cubes of strange meat that
keeps you full for hours, and an exquisite sandwich piled high with very
thinly sliced meats, cheeses and fruit, known in the shop as the “Beggars
Hoagie”, Howard’s Place is frequently standing room only. The popular
crowd gets here early, often before the ‘normal’ eating hours just to
view the crowd to see who does and does not get in for the evening. The
maitre-d, a man named Tsun, is exceptionally pleasant, taking care of
anything the patrons desire.

One of the biggest secrets of Howard’s Place is the chef, Mr. Past, a
heavily-garbed denizen of Leng. Mr. Past came to the city years ago by
dream-travel, enjoyed the available potables here, and set up shop. He is
assisted by a gaggle of sous-chefs in the main kitchen, but creates all the
exotic meals alone in a separate sub-kitchen. There he is aided by Mung,
a decidedly thin troll, who butchers meat for him. Mung has been known
to get distracted, and occasionally forgets to strain out bits of cloth in his
butchering. Tsun is quick to replace any “Beggers Hoagies” that seem
underdone, or “stringy” for the clientele.

When dungeons and dark temples have bas-reliefs of half-naked
women carved into their walls, adventurers should be aware that some
of these provocative decorations may be Dergenue, a race of intelligent,
mischievous earth elementals. They hide in walls, using their innate
ability to phase through earth and stone, and attack by reaching out to
grab at unwary passersby (high chance to surprise). Their blows cause
1d6 damage, and they may drag their victims into the wall (to swiftly
suffocate and die) if the attack roll succeeds by 4 or more points. Earthbased magic may cause 1d8 damage per spell level to a dergenue, or slay
her outright, depending upon the spell. A dergenue takes normal damage
from fire, cold, and weapons, but is otherwise immune to almost all other
attack forms. If she steps out of a wall, a dergenue must remain in contact
with earth or stone or lose 1 HP per turn, and they cannot cross a barrier
of fire or water.

Glory Hole

A grand domed covers this round temple dedicated to Aphrodite.
Lavishly furnished, this chamber resembles more of a decadent pleasure
palace rather than a place of worship. Red satin pillows and white silk
sheets cover the floor. Sling-like swings and soft fur-encased manacles
hang from the ceiling. Low and wide steps descend in the center of the
room to a round lower floor. A candid statue of the beautiful Aphrodite
stands in an uninhibited pose amid the depravity. A gold tiara (250 gp) and
a pearl necklace (150 gp) adorn the statue.
A scene of seductive debauchery covers the bas-relief wall sculptures.
Anatomically correct feminine effigies carved in amorous postures adorn
the walls. Some of the figures stand nearly free from the wall. Some of the
figures are actually 4 dergenues waiting patiently for their next victims.
One of the pillows acts as a charm person spell (saving throw resists)
to anyone touching it. If the saving throw fails, the person becomes
enamored with the first creature of the opposite sex he sees. The pillow
can only charm one creature at a time, but has unlimited uses per day.
The charm is permanent until a new creature is charmed. A failed saving
throw by a new creature touching the pillow breaks the enchantment on
the previously charmed victim.

The Dertesha are a race of aquatic humanoids dwelling in rivers and
lakes. They appear tall, thin, and human-like, but with long tentacles
in place of legs. Some are a mottled greenish-blue in colour, and
others are reddish-brown; a few have been reported yellowish-white.
Dertesha are able to travel above water – on land and through the air
– by magical watery spheres, oily and roiling in appearance. The
dertesha are slightly translucent, and their bones are sometimes visible.
Dertesha disdain physical conflict, being haughty and convinced of their
moral and intellectual superiority over the land-dwelling races. They can
cause large tentacles to erupt from any surface within 60ft, one per round,
which restrain any target they strike (saving throw if hit negates). They
may also cast Magic Missile at will. If pressed into close combat, their
touch acts as a paralytic poison that can have hallucinatory after-effects.
They may also simply drag air-breathing opponents under the water and
hold them there to drown.
Dertesha have a sophisticated culture unseen by land-dwelling races,
and they communicate frequently with creatures of elemental air and
water.

Boon Docks

Screams of terror rise from the dock district where the river meets
the sea. The ship The Incisor is under attack by a giant tentacle rising
from each side of the galley. The Incisor appears to be a merchant vessel
transporting barrels and crates of ginger, cinnamon, cassia, turmeric and
cardamom. However, hidden under the spices are packages of Black
Lotus, Mangan Herb, Dusk Reeds and other forbidden substances.
Captain Whitcomb leads the band of buccaneers. Recently the crew slew
and pillaged a clan of primitive humans on an island settlement off the
coast. The humans worshipped a water goddess (actually a nixie queen).
Among the crude gold jewelry and uncut gemstones, Captain Whitcomb
stole a large clamshell made of mother of pearl and gold inlay. Unknown
to the captain, the clamshell contains an infant nixie princess.
The furious nixie queen has charged a dertesha with rescuing the infant
and teaching the sailors a lesson. A charmed first mate stands guard
between the dertesha and the ship. The dertesha conjured large tentacles
on the underside of the ship. It stands at the end of the pier commanding
the tentacles to drag the smugglers into the water to drown. Captain
Whitcomb pleads for anyone to assist him and his crew of sailors at the
hands of the so-called water demon. He offers a reward for heroes to
become part of his prosperous crew aboard The Incisor to take the place
of the slain smugglers.
Those returning the nixie princess to her home are rewarded with a
tentacle belt. This belt can create an 8-foot tentacle on the wearer’s body
(placement is decided by the wearer). While the tentacle is not dexterous
enough to wield a weapon or magical item, it can grab smaller than
human-sized opponents, break down doors (1–3), or carry items. It has
an effective strength of 16 and can be used to attack as a bludgeoning
weapon (1d4). The belt can be used once each day for 1d4 hours, but then

must be recharged by submerging it in water for a like amount of time.
Once activated, the tentacle remains for the duration and the belt cannot
be removed (except by dispel magic or similar magic).

A horn’s lone note pierces the midnight darkness. PCs who investigate
the sound find 2 elves, a human and a dwarf running toward them through
the forested hillside. The figures are each naked, and their hair is long
and wild. Leaves and grass are matted in the greasy strands, and dirt
and mud cover their bodies. Their eyes are wide with panic. Unless PCs
calm them down, the men and women scream and run away from anyone
approaching them.
The runners are travellers captured a month ago and kept in the cellar
of a nearby manor home. The owner of the manor is an avid hunter who
abducts people to make things challenging during his midnight excursions.
He doesn’t use hounds, however; instead, he releases a pack of 12 dheziks
to chase the game. The dheziks each wear a silver collar that keeps them
from turning on the hunter. The dheziks scramble and crash through the
woods in pursuit of their prey, seeking to take down anyone they find on

Bizarre Barrage in the Bazaar

Ollie Nematoad seems to attract attention, generally unwarranted and
destructive. The halfling inventor often needs rescuing from situations he
inadvertently creates. This time, Ollie has developed an unconventional
device to unclog pipes. The device (which could be used for many
purposes) consist of a long string, a thin glass vial with a stopper, and a
flammable oily substance that ignites when exposed to air or water. His
idea is to lower the vial into a pipe until it hits a clog, then pull the string
to burn out the blockage. The vials come in many shapes and sizes to
fit the needs of the task and circumstances. He has named his invention
“Kablooey Gooey.” A potion vial-sized container (a gill) explodes in a
five-foot radius dealing 1d6 points of fire damage. His industrial-sized
containers (pint) deal 2d6 points of damage in a 10-foot radius.
After several wagon fires, Ollie decided he needed an alternative
method of safely transporting his wares. Ollie procured a semi-trained
ankylosaurus from a far-off land beyond the desert. The slow-moving yet
steady animal is the perfect mount for Ollie and his explosive wares (plus,
he receives a lot of attention when he arrives into town). Ollie secured the
top of a covered wagon atop the dinosaur. Most people clear the way as
they gawk at the sight.
On this particular day in the grand bazaar of Bard’s Gate, Ollie arrived
with the usual fanfare to sell his wares. People throughout the market stop
and stare at Ollie’s arrival; many drop items and flee in fear. One particular
half-orc in the ankylosaurus’ path drops his spiked club. The anklyosaurus
steps on the spikes (which wedge into its foot). The frightened primeval
beast reacts by rampaging through the market, clubbing everything along
the way. The harder it runs the more pain the spikes inflict. The jostling
and thrashing causes vials of Kablooey Gooey to fly from the wagon and
explode. Ollie attempts to regain control, but is powerless until the spike
club is removed. The Kablooey Gooey does not land on the ankylosaurus
but 1d4–1 vials are flung in random directions every round. On a roll of
1–4 on 6, a gill goes flying; on a 5–6, a pint tumbles out. Ollie has 100
gills and 25 pints on board (he expected to sell a lot). He charges 20 gp for
a gill and 50 gp for a pint. Needless to say, the Pipe Cleaners Guild won’t
be happy at his arrival nor the results of Kablooey Gooey being used to
unclog pipes. Ollie rewards rescuers with a discount on purchases.

The Walking Dead

Trees crash apart as a monstrous brontosaurus stumbles through the
corkwood and mangrove trunks. The dinosaur moves slowly, weighed
down by a 70-foot-wide wooden platform balanced on its back and
supported by struts driven into its sides. The platform supports a small
village of two-story houses crowded close together in the narrow space.
The homes rock and sway with the movement of the brontosaurus
supporting them. Thick vines dangle off the edges of the platform,
dragging along the ground alongside the shuffling brontosaurus. Large
boulders hang from the corners of the platform to keep the dinosaur from
rising up and shaking the village off its back.
The nomadic Walking City of Covalt Green travels where the whim of
the brontosaurus takes it. The dinosaur is ancient now, but still a strong
beast of burden. Crude trebuchets mounted along the edges of the platform
serve to keep the carnivores away from the dinosaur.
Except the normally welcoming lights of the village are dark now, and
the sounds of laughter and song are silenced. PCs climbing the vines to
the silent village find evidence of violence everywhere: bloodstains soak
into the wooden planks, scratches are clawed into the wood, and a few
skeletons are tangled in the hanging ivy and vines. The village was overrun
by a pack of 15 hungry ghouls that descended out of the trees to attack the
villagers. The ghouls killed everyone in the village who couldn’t escape
off the edges of the platform. The ghouls now ride comfortably through
the jungle, swinging down off the platform in packs to attack creatures on
the ground. The brontosaurus keeps walking even if PCs and ghouls are
fighting across its back.

Bad Luck Runs Deep

In the middle of the Reaping Sea, a series of stone pillars rise out of
the waves to mark the edge of the Laurentian Descent. The boundary of
stone columns marks the cliff where the seabed drops off into a milesdeep abyss. Legends say the goddess Muir drove the stone columns into
the sea to split the ocean floor so she could descend into the underworld.
A galleon drifts near the pillars, the ship’s sail tattered and hanging off
the masts. Luck’s Star went missing nearly a month ago after departing
Port Shaw in a search for pirates. The ship is a long way from port, and
sailing close reveals obvious damage along its hull. The wood is scratched
and scraped. The ship is empty, although PCs who climb aboard and go
below decks find a lone sailor sitting dead at the bottom of the steep stairs.
His midsection is a gory mess; he looks like he was nearly bitten in two
but still managed to fall down the ladder into the hold.
The ship was attacked by 2 elasmosaurus that rose up on either side of
the Star to pluck sailors from the deck. The mated dinosaurs swam to the
surface from their normal hunting ground within the deep trench below.
The elasmosauruses rise out of the deep to attack the ships. They focus on
grabbing victims and tossing them into the waves where they can finish
them off at their leisure.

Jurassic Spark

A lighter-than-air gas fills this canyon, the greenish wisps rising from
natural vents in the rock-strewn ground. Trapped in the canyon are 2
stegosauruses that became separated from their herd. Their plaintive cries
echo off the flint walls. PCs can breathe the gas, although it makes them a
little lightheaded and raises the pitch of their voices.
The dinosaurs are extremely agitated, and the gas makes them
unpredictable. They are easily provoked and charge PCs who approach
them. They swing their tails wildly to slash and stab at foes. The spikes on
their tail chip the rock walls as they advance. Their swinging tails have a
1 in 6 chance of creating a spark as their tail spikes slam into the canyon’s
flint walls. The spark ignites the flammable gas, setting off a blast that
does 4d6 points of damage (save for half) to anyone within a 40-foot
radius of the dinosaur.

Bull Fight

On the edge of the civilized lands stands an ancient coliseum. Hot sand
and dust constantly blow in from the rocky wasteland. Low-standing
sod block buildings and a tent bazaar surround the stadium during bouts.
Spectators seem to appear from nowhere in droves to attend the evening’s
entertainment. The spectacle consists of clowns, acrobats, minor illusions
and dancing girls. The main event is always a massive battle where the
crowds wager and legends are made.
Marna and her posse of brigands run the show. She is young,
charismatic, stunningly beautiful and utterly ruthless. She does not like
to lose. The evening’s combat promises 5,000 gp to the winner. Locals
know better than to be tempted by the prize. Posters tout a three-round
bull fight. Participants are required to wear (provided) red capes into the
arena. While Marna tolerates spells, spells that may damage the arena or
harm bystanders are not allowed. She and the crowd want to see action,
however. A disappointing show may result in a destructive riot or angry
mob.
The first round, a large bull enters the ring. The second round,
bullfighters face a minotaur wielding a trident and battleaxe. The last
round, Marna releases her newest acquisition: A triceratops she brought
from beyond the wasteland. She has grown quiet enamored with her
expensive pet.

The Weapon of the Ancients

A ring of roughhewn stone obelisks surround a 50-foot-wide sandy
patch of soil. The stones were placed here by an ancient race of primitive
people. A stone pedestal stands at one end of the colonnade. Hieroglyphics
adorn the sides of the stone. If translated, the glyphs state “Rise, weapon
of vengeance and glory. Smite those who bring evil to the mighty Clan of
the Axe. Rid the land of infidels and bring peace to our lands.” An axeshaped depression sits atop the pedestal. The bronze head of an ornate
battleaxe is embedded in the stone, but the handle is missing. Aside from
destroying the pedestal, the axe head cannot be removed by non-magical
means.
The desiccated corpse of an elf lies atop one of the larger obelisk. A
dozen barbed black orc arrows pierce the body. The elf lies facedown
and holds the decorative bronze handle of the axe head below. The elf
is difficult to spot without thoroughly searching the area. Once the axe
handle is placed in the depression on the pedestal, the weapon created
by the Clan of the Axe is complete. Below the center of the colonnade
lies a tyrannosaurus held in a powerful stasis. Placing the axe handle
on the pedestal immediately causes the ground to rumble and pitch as
an enormous sooty, opaque sphere rises from the ground. At ground
level, the sphere dissipates, leaving a cloud of dust and a rampaging
tyrannosaurus. The beast stays within a mile of the colonnade and only
follows the commands of the Clan of the Axe chieftain. After six hours,
the tyrannosaurus returns to the colonnade where its sinks into the earth.
Aside from being impervious to damage or destruction, the bronze axe has
no special abilities.

Djinn are one of the genies of folklore, creatures of the air (and possibly

a number of magical powers. A djinni can create food and water of high
quality, as well as wooden and cloth objects. They can also create objects
of metal (including coins), but all such magically created metals disappear
in time. Djinn can call up illusions, and although these are quite excellent
they disappear when touched. Djinni can turn themselves into gaseous
form (cannot attack or be attacked, can enter any area that is not airtight),
and can become invisible at will. Finally, a djinni can turn itself into
a whirlwind much like an air elemental, sweeping away any creature
with one or fewer hit dice (the diameter of the whirlwind is 10ft. More
powerful types of djinn might be capable of granting limited wishes or

Fallen statues of defaced gods lie amid the ruins.

Dynastic Marriage

Small niches line the walls of this 30-foot-tall chamber. Each niche
holds an antique oil lamp. This 80-foot-diameter chamber holds nearly
500 oil lamps. The lamps sell for between 1 to 5 gold pieces apiece. The
entire collection would sell for about 1,250 gp. A 10-foot-diameter well
sits in the center of the domed chamber. Thousands of golden rings fill the
shallow, five-foot-deep hole. Each ring is unique and most are worthless.
Only 100 of the rings have value, between 5 and 25 gp (950 gp total).
Only one lamp and one ring are made of brass. The lamps and rings melt
into a pool of molten metal (1d6 points of damage to the holder for each
item) if removed from the room. Both the lamps and rings detect as magic.
A brass and baseless statue depicting a large man stands on the opposite
side of the room from the entrance. He stands in a brusque pose with arms
crossed and a snide grin across his bearded face. The highly polished
statue radiates blistering heat.
As the chamber is entered, a small cyclone of rings rises from the
center depression. A stunning female djinni forms in the pit. Every ring
swirls in the torrent that forms her lower half. As the emotionless djinni
materializes, she states the means to her freedom. ‘’Brandish the lamp of
father. Don the ring of mother. Wary the betrayed lover. The union shall I
answer forever.”
The bearer of both the brass ring and brass lamp can command the
djinni. Finding both of these items in the chamber presents a challenge.
After she states the prophecy, the brass statue animates and relentlessly
attacks those in the chamber. Once defeated, the statue melts into a molten
pool of brass for 1d2 rounds. After the time elapses, the statue reforms at
full hit points and continues attacking. The statue is slain forever if the
ring and lamp are united.
If all the rings and lamps are removed from the chamber, the djinni
dies in a blaze of hellfire (similar to fire storm). The djinni is Dysuria, the
daughter of a djinni noble. She was betrothed to an efreeti lord’s son to
seal a peace pact a millennia ago. Doomed to fail, the arrangement was
annulled with the efreeti lord placing a curse upon his son’s betrothed.

Dastardly Dolphins

A floor-to-ceiling glass wall runs along the length of this 100-footlong hallway. The glass is thick (nearly 6 inches) and holds back a watery
enclosure containing 3 frolicking dolphins. The animals twirl and spin
through the waters, playing as they swim. Green jade panels line the walls
of the massive aquarium.
The room is a trap, however, and these decidedly evil dolphins are the
central figures in setting it off. Once PCs arrive at the center of the hall,
the dolphins stop their cavorting and charge the panels on opposite ends of
their enclosure. The dolphins simultaneously press the green panels with
their noses, which cause metal doors at either end of the hall to slam shut.
Holes in the ceiling immediately open, and water pours into the sealed
room. The hall fills with water in 2d4+6 rounds. The dolphins line the
window to watch PCs drown.

Mirror Maze Madness

Mirrors of varying sizes lines the walls of this stone corridor. The
mirrors gradually cover the walls as the party moves down the passage.
The floor and ceiling also change from common stone to highly polished
quartz. The corridor branches off in several directions, each turning and
twisting. Lanterns burning with unnaturally bright light hang from the
ceilings at regular intervals. Empty mirrored rooms break the corridors
from time to time. Eventually, the halls come back together and the
corridor returns to normal stone walls.
Some of the mirrors conceal rooms while others are actually secret
doors or one-way mirrors. A gang of 4 doppelgangers hunts these
passages. The ingenious creatures mimic prey. Hasty adventurers may
perceive the doppelgangers to be their reflections moving alongside them
down the hall. The doppelgangers try to separate the party by running off
and changing forms. Using confusion and the mirrors to keep opponents
guessing, the doppelgangers try to trap single characters in mirror
rooms. Once they separate PCs, the doppelgangers take the appearance
of the victim and attack. If battle goes against them, they take the form
of a medusa (although they lack the petrifying gaze attack) to scare off
adversaries.

Spin Cycle

This iron chamber is a 100-foot-diameter circle of steel with a central
column. The entire chamber rotates slowly around the pillar. Two doors
on opposite sides of the room line up once every 12 rounds so PCs can
enter or leave the room. The rest of the time, the doors face cold steel
walls scraping past the openings. Millions of steel ingots rise in mounds
throughout the chamber. The ingots shift and slide as the room turns.
Mixed among the ingots are gleaming gold coins pressed with a king’s
royal visage on one side and a rising phoenix on the other. The coins are
lost among the ingots, but worth 2,560 gp if collected.
A dragolem lies curled around the base of the central pillar, hidden
under the mounds of metal ingots. The dragolem waits until the PCs enter
the room before rising out of the ingots to attack. When the dragolem
rises, it steps off a pressure plate on the floor. The plate causes the room to
spin faster and faster. After 6 rounds, the room is moving so fast that the
ingots and PCs are thrown backward against the walls for 3d6 points of
damage (save for half). The good news is that the spinning room separates
the ingots and gold and makes the treasure easier to collect. The room
spins at high speed for 1d4 rounds before slowing for 2d4 rounds. It
repeats the process until the dragolem returns to the pressure plate. The
dragolem digs its claws into the metal to stay in one spot, or flies in the
middle of the room as PCs whirl around it.

The size of a dragon is roughly 5 ft of body length per age category, up to the adult size of 20 ft. Dragons have double normal treasure (that is, a gold
piece value of four times the dragon’s XP value).
Do not roll hit points for dragons as normal. Instead, determine the number of hit dice and the age category of the dragon. The age category indicates
both the dragon’s hit points per die and how much damage the dragon’s breath weapon inflicts, given as points per hit die.

Note that dragons, while they are dangerous opponents, are not by any
means invincible. In a medieval-type fantasy world, dragons are a common
problem rather than godlike creatures of legend—so the statistics for dragons reflect a deadly but not mythical foe. The Referee is, of course, free to
create stats for a more “mythical” conception of dragons. Since dice are not
rolled for dragon hit points, it is possible for a truly mythical dragon to have
more points per die than it is actually possible to roll on a hit die.
Breath Weapons: All dragons have a breath weapon of some kind, which
can be used three times in a day. The Referee chooses when a dragon
will use its breath weapon, or may roll a 60% chance in any given round.
Damage inflicted by a dragon’s breath weapon is indicated under the age
category. When used breath weapons appear in three different shapes:

The dimensions of a dragon’s breath differ according to the dragon’s type.
If a dragon is beaten down by subdual damage (see rules for Combat),
the dragon will surrender and serve its conquerors, even to the point of
allowing itself to be sold. However, subdued dragons are only loyal while
they are impressed by and frightened of their masters; signs of weakness
may cause the dragon to escape or even attack its master.
A standard-colored dragon generally has a challenge level based on its hit
points: CL=(hp/4) +2.

1 — Cloud-shape for gaseous exhalations
2 — A line, for spitting dragons
3 — Cone shape for any others.

Acid Bath

Dark shadows and black stone columns fill this cavernous stone
chamber. Glowing black spots pulse in a strobe-like effect along the walls,
causing spots to dance in the vision of PCs looking directly at the nonlights. The granite walls and floor are pitted with thousands of holes that
have eaten through the rock. Steam whistles through the porous stone. A
black-iron cage hangs from a chain 30 feet off the floor before three large
caves that exit the chamber. A steady waterfall of smoking liquid drips
from the cage. The liquid pulses and stretches in the strange black lights.
A bauxite anvil that weeps acid sits in the cage. The caustic flow falls from
the cage and spatters across the stone floor. Anyone touching the liquid
takes 3d6 points of damage (save for half).
The cavern is the home of a black dragon known to local farmers as
Ebon Death. The dragon sleeps in one of the caves. When PCs advance
toward the cave or cage, the dragon rises up and flaps its wings to spray
the dripping acid throughout the chamber. The dragon continues flapping
until PCs get close or start attacking it from a distance. The Ebon Death
leaps from the cave to attack. The dragon sleeps on a pile of treasure that
includes 2,524 gp, a melted gold stature (274 gp), a collection of cow
skulls, and a small silver flask that contains a trapped quasit.

in the darkness. The field spreads across hundreds of acres. The corn
is planted in neat rows that crisscross the low, rolling hills. Scarecrows
stand on wooden posts throughout the field. The tops of the scarecrows’
heads can barely be seen above the rows of swaying corn. A few of the
scarecrows are blackened and burned. Despite the abundance of ripe ears
of corn, it appears no one has yet harvested the crop.
A farmer’s scorched bones lie scattered across the field he planted last
spring. The poor man was killed when he entered the field to gather corn
– and came face to face with a blue dragon now living among the rows.
The dragon broke through the earth in the center of the field when it had to
dig a back entrance out of its cave network when an avalanche collapsed
the only opening. The dragon slinks through the corn, staying low to the
ground as it stalks prey. The dragon injured one of its wings during the
cave-in and won’t be able to fly for at least another month.

and 1d4 of age category 1d3)
Challenge Level/XP: Challenge Level = (hit points/4) +2
Brass dragons are greedy, but not as inimical to humankind as most of
their kin. A brass dragon can breath a cone-shaped blast of sleep gas (70ft
long, to a width of 20ft at the end), or a cloud of fear gas 50ft in diameter
(20ft from the ground to the top of the cloud). A saving throw is required
for anyone caught in a brass dragon’s breath weapon, regardless of level.
Sleep lasts until the victim is physically awakened; fear causes the victim
to flee for 3d6 rounds. Brass dragons have a 50% chance of being able to
talk; talking brass dragons have a 5% chance of being able to cast 1d4 first
level magic-user spells. Brass dragons range in size from 6 to 8 hit dice.

Brass Tacks

A chipped basalt wall rises nearly 30 feet high in the Seething Jungle.
Chunks of stone lie at the base of the stone. A screaming man is pinned
to the wall about 20 feet in the air via two brass stakes driven through his
shoulders and into the stone. His blood drips down the wall that holds
him. He doesn’t seem to feel the stakes holding him in place, however. He
struggles against the pins, but can’t pull himself free. Three more men are
pinned to the wall in similar ways, but they are asleep, their heads hanging
down against their slowly rising and falling chests.
The screaming man is a thief named Tamme. He and his adventuring
companions (the men asleep on the wall around him) discovered a treasure
trove in an ancient ruin deep in the jungle. The men were trying to figure
out how to plunder the find when the owner showed up. The brass dragon
took offense to the robbers and chased them through the jungle as they
made off with what treasure they could carry. The dragon caught each one
and pinned them to the wall to teach them a lesson. The men have been
pinned to the wall for two days. The dragon routinely breathes clouds of
gas over the thieves to cause them to sleep or struggle in fear. The dragon
sleeps in a cave concealed by thick vines where it can watch the wall. It
attacks anyone trying to free the men.

Bronze dragons are generally quite friendly to humankind. They
can spit lightning in a line 100ft long (5ft wide) or exhale a cloud of
misdirection gas in a 30ft diameter (20ft from ground to top of cloud).
The misdirection gas forces anyone failing a saving throw to retreat away
from the dragon for 6 full combat rounds. The lightning bolt causes full
damage (age category times dragon’s hit dice) on a failed saving throw,
half damage with a successful saving throw. Bronze dragons have a 70%
chance of being able to talk; talking bronze dragons have a 15% chance
of being able to cast 1d4 first level magic-user spells and 1d3 second level

Bronze Age

A series of columns lead down this sloping passage to a circular vault
sealed behind a large stone door. Wax is melted along the door’s edges,
and a three-foot-diameter wax seal sits in the center of the door. Pressed
into the wax seal is an image of a man riding a dragon. The wax is old and
brittle. Opening the door causes it to disintegrate and releases a poisonous
dust mixed into the sealing wax. Anyone within 10 feet of the door must
make a saving throw or choke to death as the dust hardens in their lungs.
Opening the door reveals a bronze dragon lying curled on the stone
floor of the vault. The dragon is ancient, and can barely lift its head. The
wyrm was entombed with its friend, the Sage-King Payot Bannon, when
the old seer died. Maelor Gawer has not moved from this tomb in nearly
300 years. The Sage-King’s body lies on a golden platform behind the
curled dragon’s still form.
Maelor has just a few hours left to live. He’s lingered alive in this
chamber well past the point he thought would be his end. He believes the
Sage-King’s life force (even in death) is letting him live on past his days.
Maelor is ready for the end, however, but has one final request. He asks
PCs to take word of his passing to the Dragon Stone high in the Hollow
Spire Mountains and carve his name into the granite monument. If PCs
fulfill this last request, Maelor’s spirit appears and tells them where the
dragon hid its treasure hoard in a sinkhole in Briar Tree Forest.

wealth. A copper dragon can choose to spit a line of acid 5ft wide and 60ft

Copper Wired

Screams sound from the marketplace in Taharath, and farmers run
frantically from the clustered stalls set up to sell hand-beaten weapons,
fresh produce, rare herbs and roots, and live chickens. Something large
crashes through the stalls, ripping and tearing at the boards and cloth
curtains. People scream “The beast!” as they grab their children and flee.
A copper dragon dropped in on the market. The dragon’s mind is
crazed and its head and eyes jerk with nervous tics as it rips into the
various sellers’ stalls. The dragon recently ate a herd of goats that had
been munching on a field of hallucinogenic plants. The dragon was
coming down off its high when its sensitive nose smelled more of the
plants (and fresh goats) in the market. As the creature landed atop a stall,
chaos erupted around it. The dragon is wild, attacking stalls, trees and the
air. Any PCs who get in front of the dragon may be seen as foes come to
harm the delusional, addicted creature.

The Gold Bearer

A gold dragon shambles across the dirt fields outside Woodburn. The
massive wyrm shakes its head angrily and occasionally stops to claw at its
skull like a dog scratching a flea. Its skin is covered in old scars and fresh
blood. A blood-stained collar with dangling skulls attached to it hangs
around the dragon’s neck. The skulls rattle with each shake of the dragon’s
massive head. Its eyes are cloudy gray orbs and it stumbles into fence
posts and trees as if blind.
The gold dragon was tricked into putting on the collar, and its mind is
now overwhelmed by the enchanted item. The true danger comes from
the collar – and the demi-lich hanging among the skulls. The demi-lich
has some control over the dragon, and can direct its movement. It cannot
cause the dragon to attack or defend itself, however. The dragon swings
its head toward PCs, allowing the demi-lich to attack. If the demi-lich
is destroyed, the dragon stands motionless until the collar is cut off it. It
thanks PCs profusely if freed, and grants them a boon.

Swamp Gas

Gouts of green flame rise 20 feet above the Sin Mire Swamp in roiling
balls of fire. The flaming geysers erupt from the surface of the mossy peat
floating like a wave of thick mud atop the bog. Four black stone pillars
rise out of the swamp to support a rock platform. A small temple overrun
by thousands of normal frogs sits atop the stone foundation. The rhythmic
balls of flame lick the bottom of the platform. Blackened vines hang down
from the platform to nearly touch the bog below.
A green dragon sleeps in the muck beneath the abandoned temple. The
gouts of fire are the result of thick swamp vapors mixing with the dragon’s
poisonous snores. The mixing gases ignite to form the balls of green flame
rising out of the swamp. The green dragon stores its treasure inside the
abandoned temple. The creature rises out of the muck to attack anyone
wading into the sludge to get to its hoard.

The Dragon Slayer

A glowing marble bier sits on a grassy knoll rising in the middle of the
Fields of Kelt. Gardens of flowers grow in five distinct sections around the
slight rise. One triangular patch contains red roses, and another has white
lilies. A third has blue asters while the fourth has green hydrangeas. The
fifth contains purplish-black tulips. A narrow path of golden stones rises
up the incline to the bier. A glass enclosure sits atop the bier, protecting the
remains of a skeletal warrior lying on the marble slab.
The skeleton is dressed in a chain mail shirt with a red tunic emblazoned
with a rising sun. His armor is burned and blackened in spots, and several
large rents are sliced through the chain links. A long sword lies beside
the remains. Its pommel has a dragon’s head breathing fire on it. An
engraved plate at the skeleton’s feet reads “Doblut the Brave, Dragon
Slayer Extraordinaire.” The glass encasing the body shatters easily if
anyone strikes it. The sword is a replica of the dragon slayer’s real blade.
It crumbles into shards of rusty metal if touched.
Disturbing Doblut’s bones draws an ancient curse placed on the
warrior’s bones when he was laid to rest. The curse summons a red dragon
to protect the bones. The dragon is as surprised as PCs, and immediately
attacks. The dragon can appear flying or on the ground, and forgiving
Referees might change the color of the dragon based on the PCs’ abilities.
The dragon slayer’s real sword – a +3 glowing bastard sword that
kills dragons on a roll of a natural 20 – lies encased in the marble bier
supporting Doblut’s bones. Destroying the bier is the only way to get
the sword. PCs who fail to rebury the dragon slayer’s bones may find
themselves facing other curses.

Tarnished Silver

Twitching bodies lie in the cobblestone streets of the small hamlet
of Lilly. Many of the people foam at the mouth, while others jerk
spasmodically in the dirt. A fine layer of silver ash coats the street and
bodies. The people of Lilly are still alive, although barely. Their eyes are
rolled back in their heads and they are unresponsive.
The villagers are victims of a silver dragon living among the mountain
cliffs overlooking the village. Argennones the Lustrous sleeps in a
cave overrun in recent years by a creeping moss that causes delusions
and incites anger in anyone breathing the red spores. The dragon’s mind
is clouded by delusions, and he gave up on protecting the villagers and
instead turned to gassing them to keep them quiet. The dragon regularly
flies over the houses and breathes paralytic gas to subdue the villagers.
The dragon’s lungs are coated by spores that extend the paralytic poison’s
effects to 2d6 days instead of hours. The villagers have been paralyzed for
less than a day so far, but begin dying of dehydration in another couple
of days. PCs can wait for the dragon to find them or seek him out in his
mountainside cave.

The Whites of His Eyes

A collection of eyeballs dominates this blue-hued room in the Wailing
Glacier. Sapphire-colored algae in the ice give the room its color. One
large archway cut through the ice leads downward into the depths of the
glacier’s interior. The eyes are stuck to the 20-foot-tall frozen walls in
hundreds of places, and line the floor like misshapen eggs. Other eyes sit
in recessed pockets cut into the walls. The eyeballs appear to have been
cut from various creatures and range in size from a hummingbird’s eye to
the size of a person’s head.
One of the eyes belongs to Iciilivennik, a white dragon that hunts the
lands around the Wailing Glacier. The dragon stares through a hole that
connects with her icy lair on the other side of the wall. Once PCs enter the
eye room, she pulls away from the wall and breathes a cone of frost at the
wall of her lair. The eyes plug many more holes cut through the ice, and
allow the frost to come blasting through in 6 icy torrents. Iciilivennik’s
treasure hoard lies frozen in clear blocks of ice in her chamber, and
includes nearly 2,400 gp and the body of a frozen halfling.

The Turtle King’s Retinue

A funeral barge floats slowly down the river, carrying a dead priestking and his belongings to the afterlife. Four golden statues face inward to
hold aloft a brightly decorated sarcophagus in the middle of the 30-footwide-by-60-foot-long barge. Piled under the suspended sarcophagus are
a bounty of riches, including 600 gp, hundreds of loose gems (1,500 gp
total), a silver scepter and a dozen cat statues with emerald eyes (100 gp
each). The body in the sarcophagus is wrapped in white linen and wears
a golden crown (150 gp) on its head. The crown has a top like a tortoise
shell. Hundreds of turtles crawl across the barge.
The body was that of beloved King Nephealin of the Crescent Reaches.
The good king took his greatest secret to his grave: He was actually an
intelligent turtle transformed into a man. When he finally died of old age,
his reptilian brothers came out to accompany his body downriver. The
normal turtles are harmless, but the barge is being propelled by a dragon
turtle swimming underwater. The dragon turtle stops pushing the barge
and attacks if PCs try to rob the great king of his treasures.

Cat Wants Your Tongue

Eston Judd’s farmhouse sits near a babbling brook in the middle of
hundreds of acres of fields. The farmer’s cattle roam freely about the
fields, kept in by wooden fences that line the property’s boundaries. A dirt
road leads up to the farmhouse, where chickens peck at the ground and
the farmer’s six grandchildren get underfoot. Eston sits in a rocking chair
on the porch, a well-used scythe at his side and a dour look on his face.
Eston’s cows are under attack, and he doesn’t know who – or what –
to blame. So far, six cows have been killed, their heads ripped clean off
their bodies. A monstrous roar in the middle of the night usually means
he’ll find a cow decapitated the next morning. The farmer needs someone
to watch over his cows at night, and he’s willing to pay up to 10 gp per
person. He fears whatever is stalking the cattle might one day come for
him and his grandchildren.
The cattle are under attack by a dragonne that has developed a taste for
cow tongue. It rips the cows heads off, eats their tongues and leaves the
rest of the meat for scavengers. The dragonne has a cave in the hills near
Eston’s fence line.

The Draug are a race of 8ft tall, bear-like humanoids with wolf-like
heads and tails. They are brave warriors and strong drinkers, and their
shield-lined longhouses resound to boasting and merriment. The “wolfbear folk” fight with spear, axe, dagger, or broad sword, and gain +2 to hit

of hack-silver jewelry, weapons and shields of fine craftsmanship and
exquisite decoration, and kegs of mead. Suggestions they were created by
the same eccentric wizard responsible for the Owl Bear will be met with
howls of laughter, and an overflowing tankard of mead.

Guard Draugs

A girl weeps at the base of a willow tree. She clutches a teddy bear to
her side as she sobs. She has yellow hair and big blue eyes. She wears a
purple dress that has seen better days. Her knees are dirty from kneeling
on the ground. Her cheeks are red from crying. If approached, she shies
away from PCs at first before breaking down and telling them that her
parents are missing. She claims they were taken by “bear dogs.” She says
her name is Hildy. She asks PCs to rescue her parents, and leads them to
where they are being held.
The marble mausoleum is nestled amid the mighty forest oaks. The
structure has a peaked roof and a single door. Standing in front of the
door are 2 draugs. Each creature holds the leash of a winter wolf that
lies at the draug’s feet. The draugs laugh at the sound of someone inside
the mausoleum screaming. Occasionally, another draug steps out of the
mausoleums door and shares a joke with the guards. He wipes his bloody
hands on his fur before going back inside. The screaming starts anew soon
afterward.
The draugs recently stopped 2 doppelgangers trying to infiltrate their
camp. The doppelgangers didn’t count on the draugs sniffing out their
disguises as they marched into the longhouse. The pair barely escaped
with their lives, but lost each other in the forest. One was captured
immediately as he hid in the mausoleum. The other assumed the guise of
“Hildy” to trick PCs into rescuing her partner. The draugs snarl viciously
at PCs if they approach with the doppelganger. Hildy hopes to rescue her
mate as the PCs and draug fight.

Web of Command

A 100-foot-ball of webs hangs from the high ceiling of this cavernous
chamber. Stalactites hang down around the web ball. The ball is suspended
from the rocky cave roof by a 20-foot-diameter strand of webbing. A
10-foot-diameter circular hole cut in the side of the globe makes it look
like a giant beehive. Crawling across the outer surface of the globe are
thousands of normal spiders and 10 giant spiders. The bones of thousands
of creatures are barely visible beneath the sticky strands.
The web ball is the command sphere of a band of driders that terrorizes
the land above. Drider Adjutant General Lierech Voem wields a +3
bone staff topped with a drow skull and is renowned for his ferocity in
combat. The staff causes confusion (as per the spell) in anyone it hits who
fails a saving throw. He is accompanied by 6 drider warriors who are
as loyal as they are bloodthirsty. The interior of the web ball is decorated

The drow are dark elves, denizens of the Under Realms, dwellers in
darkness. They have coal-black skin and white hair. These creatures of
chaos despise the surface-dwelling servants of Law, and would certainly
choose to eradicate them if the drow themselves did not dislike sunlight.
All attacks made by drow in sunlight, or in even magical light, will be
made at a penalty of -2.
All drow have the following spell-like powers: darkness 15ft radius,
ability to limn a target in faint light at a range of 60ft (all have +1 to hit
the victim), and the ability to create lantern-like lights at a range of 60ft.
All drow wear +1 chain mail and carry +1 longswords. They wear cloaks
and boots that make them difficult to see and hear (75% chance to surprise).
All of this equipment will decay in sunlight, becoming useless after 2d6
days of normal exposure. Roughly half of normal drow will also be carrying
hand-crossbows that fire poison darts (1d3 damage, sleep poison save at -4).
Drow are capable of advancing in level, and their leaders may be
considerably more dangerous than the normal 2HD (Ftr2) drow. Male
drow may have magic-user levels up to 12, and fighter levels up to 7.
Female drow may have fighter levels up to 9, and magic –user or cleric

Ambush!

Travelling along a narrow stretch of cavern, it eventually opens up into
a 15 foot passage that allows free movement. A constant dripping can be
heard in the lightless environment, although where the sounds is coming
form is difficult to determine. The surrounding stone is quite cool to the
touch, and a inconsistent breeze issues from somewhere in the vast void
of darkness.
Taking a moment to catch your collective breath after squeezing through
the rent in the surrounding rock, the party may notice (1 on d6) a slight
tapping sound from up ahead, as if metal were hitting stone, oh so softly.
If the party approaches the sound, when their torchlight reaches far
enough, they notice a cloaked figure perched atop a boulder, head down
and tapping a metal rod of some kind on the stone.
If the party speaks, or after a few minutes of being in the torchlight,
the figure raises its head. “You shouldn’t be here, surfacers, “ it says in
Elvish.” This wasn’t meant for you, but it looks like you scared away our
prey. Y ou’ll do.” The party is attacked by 12 drow warriors emerging
from the darkness as well as their captain, Mirridon. Half the drow fire
hand crossbows, while the others move to engage the party hand-to-hand.

Tear Down That Wall

A 30-foot-tall unfinished stone tower stands atop this small hillock.
Sunflowers and lilacs grow abundantly around it, and flowering vines
climb the granite blocks. The top of a tree grows out of the tower’s open
roof. The tree’s canopy spreads out above the tower’s top, casting deep
shadows down the tower’s walls. Branches push out through the walls,
breaking through the stone. Colorful leaves spread into the sky. A woman
lounges on a high branch above the tower. A white banner drapes over the
limb she rests on. Hanging from a noose tied in the end of the banner is a
dead hill giant.
Another hill giant works at the base of the tower, fashioning mud
into stone blocks. The giant’s face is streaked with sweat, mud and tears,
and his hands are coated in the thick glop. He is building a new layer of
stones around the current tower. The new stone wall rises 15 feet around
the current structure. The giant is the brother of the giant hanging in the
noose. The dryad tired of her former slave and ordered him to kill himself
to torment the brother who kept trying to rescue him. After his death, the
giant’s twin decided to brick off the tree to slowly kill the dryad. He is
immune to the dryad’s charm, unlike his brother.
The dryad pleads for help from passing PCs. She uses her charm ability
as a last resort, hoping PCs take care of the giant before discovering her
true nature. She won’t hesitate to charm PCs afterward to destroy the wall
for her.

The duergar, often called the “dark dwarves,” are foul-tempered
creatures that loathe intruders to their underground realms—but not nearly
as much as they do their kinfolk closer to the surface. Duergar dwell in
communities deep underground, and appear as darker, more twisted
versions of normal dwarves. Their skin is a dull gray, as though rubbed
with dust or ash, but this is a natural coloration that better allows them to
blend with their underground surroundings. They are a race of slavers,
but while non-dwarven prisoners are usually put to backbreaking work,
dwarves are generally slain on the spot.
Duergar can turn invisible once per day, and can also double their
size once per day (this allows the duergar to attack as a 4HD creature,
and heals 50% of any damage the duergar had taken prior to the change).
Duergar leaders gain +2 to hit rather than an increase in hit dice.

Hi ho!

Following a tunnel that has been going for what seems like miles, it
finally opens slightly into a modest natural cavern, 50 feet in diameter.
Several tents and a few shabby lean-tos are erected around the perimeter.
Barely a scant few feet separate each modest structure.
What room there is between tents is filled with all manner of creatures;
drow, humans, orcs, goblins and other less identifiable creatures mingle in
what looks to be some kind of underground market place.
Six duergar merchants are busy peddling their wares to the highest
bidder. Any item could possibly be here (Referee’s discretion), but the
biggest trade by far is in slaves. Several races are bound in chains; a troll
is currently being haggled over. Should the PCs decide to intervene (good
characters are almost obliged to, if for no other reason than the deplorable
condition of the slaves), they face a myriad of foes drawn from both
underground and surface races.

Hors’ Dwarf

A tree trunk sits over a 10-foot-wide firepit. The bare trunk is held in
the air by two large boulders placed across the smoldering pile of ash
from one another. A cave opens into the hillside behind the firepit. A mule
stands on its hind legs and pushes against the log with its front hooves.
The mule doesn’t make a sound as it works. A dwarf tied to the trunk with
leather straps wriggles angrily but is unable to escape his predicament.
The dwarf is tied underneath the log, with straps wrapped around his
forehead, legs and body. The straps are tied in crude knots on the other
side of the log from the squirming dwarf.
Fuglish Ashenchisel is a dwarf prospector who works the Irontrace
Hills looking for gold. He stumbled upon a gold vein in the nearby cave,
but in his haste he didn’t realize he’d stumbled into the lair of 2 ettins. The
ettins returned from a hunting trip and surprised the dwarf. The tired ettins
tied the dwarf to the tree to roast him after their nap. Fuglish’s highly
intelligent mule Maggard was smart enough to hide from the creatures.
He returned later to free his owner. The ettins charge out of the cave

Dwelvers were once a race of dwarves that followed their greed to the
elemental plane of earth to mine it for its riches. Throughout the millennia
they slowly began to change into the very substances they sought. While
still resembling dwarves in form, they are made of stone, ores and gems.
Dwelvers are malevolent and greedy and will defend their claims against
all comers. They now exist only to mine worlds of their mineral resources,
which they use to create more of their race. Groups of Dwelvers are able
to summon Earth Elementals, which will serve them faithfully. At least
eight Dwelvers are needed to summon an 8 hit dice Earth Elemental,
twelve for one of 12 hit dice and sixteen to summon one of 16 hit dice. It
is also likely Dwelvers are able to employ other earthen magics.

Whistle While You Work

A whistling tune echoes through the granite tunnels of Hopewell Peak,
the jaunty sounds bouncing through the mine’s stone corridors. The sound
comes from 8 dwelvers walking around a mine cart that tromps slowly
forward on four elephantine legs. The whistling comes from holes cut
through the dwarf-like bodies of the dwelvers as they move. The dwelvers
stop occasionally to dig into the rock walls as they mine gold ore and
gems. They toss anything they find into the self-moving cart. The cart
currently contains 643 gp worth of ore and 15 gems worth a total of 1,780
gp.
The dwelvers are highly territorial and attack any “claim jumpers” they
find in their mine. The dwelvers’ whistling tune turns into a tea-kettle
scream as they leap into combat. The cart is an 8 HD earth elemental

still embedded in its body) to join the dwelvers in defending their tunnels.

An eagle’s shrieks echo through the high peaks of the Hollow Spire
Mountains, but the sound is not majestic and awe-inspiring. Instead, it is
filled with pain and terror. A flat rock jutting from the side of the mountain
reveals the scene: 3 ogres have a giant eagle pinned to the ground by its
wings. One holds a large club ready to kill the bird. The thrashing bird is
fighting back, but on its back it is no match for the stronger ogres. One
of the ogres wears a wyvern’s skull on its head. It carries a massive spear
topped with the stinger of the slain beast.
The ogres discovered the eagle’s nest and climbed up to get to the
fledglings for a quick meal. They grabbed the mother out of the air when
she tried to protect her family. If rescued, the giant eagle remembers the
deed and arrives with friends to offer PCs a ride when they require it.

Hot Spot

Thick snow flies through the air, the forward edge of a freezing wind
that slices through clothing to turn skin to ice. Torches flicker in the strong
winds, and vision is limited by the driving snow. Drifts move steadily
across the deepening snowfield, making it tougher and tougher every
moment to slog forward. A flickering red glow in the whiteness is an
inviting promise of warmth in this hellish chill. A carved oak staff sticks
from the thawing ground in a muddy 20-foot-diameter clearing. Atop the
staff, a red ruby flickers and pulses. The gemstone radiates a welcoming
heat that melts the snow around it.
The staff was placed here by the natives of the Northern Ice, who
trapped an efreeti in the ruby’s facets. The powerful genie is powerless
as long as the gem remains in cold climates. If taken south where snow
doesn’t cover the ground year-round, the gem shatters in an explosion of
fire and heat (3d6 points of damage to any standing within 10 feet, save
for half) as the efreeti bursts forth, angry at his years in isolation. The staff
has no other magical properties.

Daring Young Halfling . . .

A large kite flutters dangerously through the air before a 100-foot-tall
column of air twisting across the ground behind it. The tornado slams
through the hillsides, tearing trees from their roots and tossing large
boulders across the plains like they were toys. Dirt flutters in spasming
ribbons around the twister’s swirling winds. A halfling strapped to the kite
shouts with joy at the wild ride, somehow guiding his flimsy kite out of
the way as the tornado slashes at it with arm-like swirls of torrential wind.
The halfling inventor Ollie Nematoad attached a white diamond (2,000
gp) stolen from the plane of air to the kite he rides, hoping it would power
his craft. Instead, it drew an angry elemental to retrieve the gem. The
air elemental tears across the plains, wreaking havoc as it goes. Whether
Ollie sees PCs and glides overhead to “impress” them is left to the GM’s
discretion …

The Gem of Tides

Lava rocks surround a dangerous tide pool of crashing waves on the
edge of the Reaping Sea. A rock pillar in the middle of the tide pool has a
gleaming jewel sitting atop it. The blue agate (1,000 gp) flashes brightly
as it beats like a pulse to signal each pounding wave. The waves slam the
rocks, then pull back quickly, dragging anything cast into the water into
the ocean depths within moments. PCs that fall into the water must make
a saving throw to grab a handhold or be pulled outward, taking 4d6 points
of damage as he is yanked over the jagged rocks of the tide pool.
The lava rocks around the tide pool are an earth elemental tasked
with protecting the Gem of Tides. The elemental rises up to smash anyone
trying to claim the stone. It attempts to throw PCs into the tide pool to let
the dangerous waters deal with them. It follows anyone who steals the
gem, attacking mercilessly until the gem is returned. The gem can locate
water (always active), grants the bearer water breathing (always active),
can create water (10/day), can lower water (3/day), and allows the bearer
to summon and control a water elemental once a month.

Flame Eternal

A 50-foot-diameter rocky tunnel slants downward into the earth.
Natural gas vents billow nauseating green fumes along its length, filling
the cavern with a thick miasma of flammable vapors. The ceiling of the
cave is alive with flame from the constant flow of rising gases. The flames
roil and hiss across the stone, almost as if speaking in sibilant whispers.
The burned corpses of a pair of ogres lie on the floor of the cavern. The
air smells of burning hair and flesh. A red ruby (2,000 gp) floats in the
burning flames near the ceiling.
The flames have been burning in this cavern for nearly 30 years as the
unexhausted supply of gas continues filling the tunnel. The constant fire
spontaneously opened a doorway to the plane of fire, allowing creatures
of elemental energy a portal into the world. The doorway is currently
watched by a fire elemental that leaps through the blazing sheet of flame
on top of trespassers in the tunnel. The floating ruby is a stolen treasure
taken from an efreet’s palace on the plane of fire. The ogres tried to grab
the ruby but invoked the wrath of the fire elemental.

Wasted Effort

A single-person outhouse stands alongside a quickly flowing stream.
The well-built privy has double doors and a comfortable cushion situated
on a heated marble slab. A washbasin of flowing water stands along the
outer wall. The outhouse is the private “getaway” for a young prince with
an extremely shy bladder. Unfortunately, the prince isn’t very well liked,
and a nefarious cousin paid an evil wizard to devise a way to do the poor
lad in.
The cousin rigged the seat of the outhouse to drop an enchanted sulfur
stone into the water well beneath the privy when someone sat down. The
wizard trapped a water elemental in the sulfur stone. When the stone
hits the water below, it is released. The angry elemental erupts out of the
privy’s hole in a shower of dirty water and waste, angry at its current
environment. The underground stream connects to the river, allowing the
elemental to jump from the outhouse to the stream without effort.

Little White Mice

Borsille’s town square is festive and alive with bunting hanging from
balconies, rose petals on the ground, and doves flying in white flocks that
wheel overhead. The festival celebrates the upcoming union of two houses
of elven royalty. Throngs of people fill the streets for the posh wedding,
and everyone seems to have worn their brightest and best clothing. The
elven families arrive soon after, riding atop 3 trained elephants carrying
ornate howdah’s on their backs. The elephants stomp through the streets as
the children creep closer and closer to get a good look at the pachyderms.
Suddenly, a scream erupts from the front of the crowd, and the lead
elephant trumpets in terror as someone tosses a box of little white mice
at its feet. The elephant rises onto its back legs, throwing the bride from
the howdah. The enraged animal charges through the crowd in a panic,
bowling people out of the way and squashing those who refuse to move.
The other elephants follow its lead. The groom and his parents cling to
the howdahs. If rescued, they reward PCs with places of honor in the
wedding (when it finally begins) and gift bags containing 100 gp, a ruby
and diamond ring (50 gp) and an ornate candelabra with scented candles.

of Tolkien’s The Hobbit, or the high Elves of the Lord of the Rings, or
might be the faerie folk of Irish legend. In any case, the Referee should
not bother trying to fit an idea of “advanced” Elves into the constraints
of character classes—just assign their attributes to fit the concept. Nonplayer characters are not subject to the rules that govern building a player

The Hallawstack Brigands

The bodies of six dwarves are tied to the dead trees of the Hallawstack
Trees by their black beards. Each dwarf’s body is cut and bruised,
and arrows protrude from their backs. The arrows have ostrich feather
fletching. The dwarven bodies have no treasure. They have been dead for
six days. One of the dead dwarves is now a zombie that sits facing tree
until PCs approach. Its violent death caused it to awake as one of the
undead.
A small band of brigands roams through the scarred oaks known as
the Hallawstack Trees. The forest of dead limbs and twisted branches
grows where runoff from the dwarven forges of Gortlesnaid killed the
once-beautiful forest. The brigands move silently through the trees like
black ghosts, wearing the dark colors of the dead forest. The 7 elves are
led by Annelise Hallawstack, the daughter of the elven lord who named
the dying forest. The elves attack anyone – especially dwarves – who
enter the dead trees. They use their bows to drive creatures from the dead
forest. The brigands live in hidden treehouses high atop the dead oaks.
The dwarves wandered into the woods in search of a lost relic of their god
and met the angry forest protectors.

Ethereal Shade
Hit Dice: 8
Armor Class: 1 [18]
Attacks: Icy touch (2d6) or befuddlement
Saving Throw: 8
Special: Hard to see, immune to non-magic weapons.
Move: 9
Alignment: Chaos
Number Encountered: 1
Challenge Level/XP: 10/1,400
An ethereal shade resembles a mass of black, wispy smoke, which
billows and contracts as it floats about. Ethereal Shades are undead and
are thus affected by a cleric’s Turn Undead ability (treat as a Type 9
undead). At night, or in darkness, it becomes nearly invisible. The referee
may require a check or saving throw to spot an ethereal shade in such
conditions. Battling an ethereal shade in dimly illuminated environments
incurs a -4 penalty to hit. The ethereal shade inflicts damage by use of
its icy touch. Ethereal Shades are immune to damage from non-magical
weapons.
By wrapping itself around a victim’s head, the ethereal shade may
momentarily distract and befuddle its foe. The effects are similar to a
Confusion spell and last as long as the ethereal shade remains wrapped
around the victim’s head. Any damage inflicted upon the creature while
it is wrapped around a foe will result in the ethereal shade taking half the
damage, and its engulfed victim taking the other half.

Shades of Evil

The Baymoral Estate’s haunted past keeps people away from its
sprawling grounds. Lady Baymoral slaughtered her family over a dinner
slight, then hung the servants and later herself from the rafters in the foyer.
The estate fell into disrepair soon after, with no one willing to spend an
evening in a place of pure evil.
The dining hall inside the manor is a place of continuing madness.
The dark room has heavy velvet tapestries that cover the windows.
Dark splotchy bloodstains mar portraits of the Baymoral family still
hanging on the walls. A silver serving set (70 gp) and silver knives and
forks (100 gp) sit on the table where they were last used. The white lace
tablecloth is covered by patches of rust-colored mold. Rotted food sits on
porcelain plates. Sitting in the plush chairs are the undead bodies of Lady
Baymoral’s family. There are 7 zombies and 2 skeletons in the seats.
Each wears moldy clothing, fresh from the grave. The undead re-enact the
last moment of their life each night. PCs disturb them at their peril. The
zombies were poisoned by the roast lamb Lady Baymoral cooked, then
stabbed to death with their utensils. The skeletons were pushed into the
fireplace and burned alive.
Lady Baymoral is the true danger in the room. She became an ethereal
shade after her death. Her spirit haunts the dining table. She rises from a
decorative centerpiece to surround the heads of those she killed in a vain
attempt to kill them again. The shade moves to attack PCs who interrupt
the last meal. Lady Baymoral assumes anyone in the manor is a lost
member of the family whom she failed to kill.

Rope Trick

A run-down wooden stall sits just outside the entrance to the empty
and abandoned Burgose Mine. Coils of silk rope lie on the stall’s wooden
tabletop, and rusty picks sit in dirt. An old, rusted lantern lies on its side
on the table. Black lamp oil darkens the wooden surface. Just inside the
mine entrance hangs the body of an elf. A coil of the silk rope is wrapped
around his neck.
The coils of rope on the table are actually lines of incredibly sticky
spider-silk that trail down the back of the stall and then up the wall into the
mine. The lines inside the mine are smeared with coal dust to hide them
against the dirty cave walls. An ettercap stands on an overhanging ledge
inside the mine entrance with 3 giant spiders. The giant spiders yank the
coils of rope if anyone becomes tangled in them. Anyone failing a saving
throw is pulled into the mine and up to the ledge for the spiders to attack.
The elf’s body is drained of blood. The ettercap hung the corpse to draw
people into the mine if they avoided his rope trap.

Fire Wardens

Blazing walls of fire cut off three of the four archways exiting this
temple’s square sanctum. The burning flames rise from natural gas vents
in the floor, and extend past the ceiling in troughs cut through the stone
walls. The ceiling is covered in soot from the billowing smoke and burned
black by the intense heat. The only exit is out of the hall through great
double doors. Marble statues of fire entities stand in niches along the wall.
Illusory flames flicker about the sculptures. The gleaming blue-and-gold
checkerboard tile floor is marred by a series of large footprints burned into
the tiles. The footprints crisscross the room randomly, making it difficult
to determine who or what created them. A gold chandelier hangs from
the high-peaked ceiling. A grand staircase rises to a second floor that
overlooks the first. A 20-foot-wide basin containing a thick, syrupy liquid
sits at the base of the staircase.
The walls of flame are very real, and do 2d6 points of damage each
round to anyone touching them. The three rooms behind the flame
curtains are home to 3 ettins. The ettins guard the temple for Ilcevila
Blaze, the temple’s azer priestess. Each chamber contains soft animal furs
for a bed, singed animal carcasses and random bones, and a large basin
filled with more of the amber liquid found in the sanctum’s fountain. The
ettins bathe head to toe in the coppery-smelling liquid, which sticks to
their bodies and allows them to pass freely through the flaming curtains
without being burned. The liquid dries out within a few hours if removed
from the basins.
The oily liquid is flammable, and turns the ettins into burning pyres
that charge through the curtains of flame to attack intruders. The oil burns
off in 10 rounds, but the basin in the main room contains more of the
liquid so the ettins can return to their separate rooms. The ettins do an
additional 1d6 points of damage with each burning strike. They use the
flame curtains to their advantage, tossing foes through the infernos if they
can.

Dead Ant, Dead Ant

A stone tower on a large sandy hill is draped with the linked bodies
of giant ant exoskeletons. The ants’ bodies form a chitinous ramp to the
top of the squat 60-foot-tall structure. The husks are linked with insect
secretions to form a nearly unbreakable ramp to the top. The top of the
tower is open to the elements. A stone sarcophagus shaped like a massive
beetle sits in the open rotunda.
The sarcophagus contains the body of Ystugrid Flux, a high priest of
the Vermin Lord Rachiss. Thousands of millipedes and centipedes fill the
coffin, crawling over one another and through the bones of the ancient
priest. The cleric’s skeletal body clutches a silver staff shaped like a
centipede that continually generates the tiny vermin. A long-forgotten
command word is the only way to stop the staff from spewing forth the
insects. Also lying in the coffin are six pink diamonds (75 gp each), a
sealed jar of leathery eyeballs, and a beetle brooch (150 gp).
The tower is protected by 15 giant ant exoskeletons that rise from the
sandy ant hill at the base of the tower to chase anyone climbing the ramp.

A line of 3 giant beetle exoskeletons march resolutely down the road,
the insect bodies marching in unison as they advance. The front and rear
insects are adorned with torn black cloths that hang down over their legs.
Poles with faded pennants are driven into the backs of their empty husks.
The center beetle has a detailed engraving of a dour-looking man worked
into its carapace. The words “In Service of Rachiss, Long May He March”
glow with a feeble light along the side of the center insect.
The beetles are the funeral procession of Lord Lucius Caddisfly, a high
priest of the Vermin Lord Rachiss. Caddisfly’s followers placed his body
inside the center beetle exoskeleton upon his death, and set the procession
in motion. The exoskeletons have been marching for nearly six years.
They turn and fight anyone who tries to stop their progress. Caddisfly’s

The Blade Bearer

A 20-foot-diameter giant crab exoskeleton walks laboriously through
the open gates of Milhaven. The crab’s body is covered by swords,
daggers and stray bits of armor. The creature attacks randomly, its pincers
snapping wildly at anyone approaching it. Runes on the exoskeleton glow
with each strike against it. As the creature passes, loose metal flies through
the air and sticks to its body. Many of the soldiers who stand before it
find themselves weaponless as their swords fly at the creature and become
stuck to its sides.
The exoskeleton has a powerful lodestone inside the inner shell that
attracts nearby metal. A frail wizard created the monstrosity to precede
him into battle, but he didn’t expect his first fight to be against a group
of monks using wooden staves. Anyone fighting the creature must make
a saving throw with each attack or their weapon flies out of their hands
and becomes stuck to the exoskeleton. A weapon can be pulled free with
another saving throw. Most of the weapons are rusted and worthless, but
stuck to the shell are a +1 long sword, a ring of protection +2, and a +2
shield.

Eagle, Giant to eyeless filcher — Monstrosities

Eyeless Filcher
Hit Dice: 9
Armor Class: 3 [16]
Attacks: 2 claws (1d8)
Saving Throw: 6
Special: Immune to non-magic weapons, strangle, half
damage from non-blunt weapons
Move: 12
Alignment: Chaos
Number Encountered: 1
Challenge Level/XP: 12/1,700
An eyeless filcher is the undead body of a criminal maimed or tortured
to death in brutal punishment for its crimes; usually these criminals were
guilty of particularly heinous crimes during life. These creatures are
animated by an extremely powerful undead force, which causes fear and
horror in any onlooker: at the sight of an eyeless filcher, anyone failing a
saving throw will either flee in terror for 1d12 rounds or be paralyzed until
the undead is out of sight (equal chance). The eyeless filcher shares the
same resistances and weaknesses of other powerful undead; it is immune
to cold-based and mind-affecting spells, magical weapons are required to
hit it, it can be turned by a cleric (as a wraith), and suffers harm from holy
water (2d8). As there is precious little flesh left on its bones, the eyeless
filcher suffers half damage from edged and pointed weapons. It may be
distracted by the sight of symbols of law and justice, such as the insignia
of the city watch or the holy symbol of a deity of law, and will break off
attacking to focus its rage on this image. An eyeless filcher retains any
criminal knowledge and thieving skills it had in life, and will use these to
its advantage. In combat, if both of its claw attacks hit, it latches on with
inhuman strength, strangling for automatic damage (2d6 total) per round
thereafter; its deadly grip can only be broken by distracting symbols as
above, the death of its victim, or a sincere apology from anyone involved
in its own capture, trial, and punishment. If the eyeless filcher manages
to kill an officer of the law, whether guard or magistrate or scribe of the
court, the unfortunate victim rises from the dead the next day as a doublestrength zombie under its control. The eyeless filcher attacks and steals,
deliberately causing as much chaos and fear as it can. If a law officer
renounces his profession in the creature’s presence it will sink to the
ground, destroyed, with a mocking laugh.

The creature wears a blindfold over its eyes (although this doesn’t stop it
from sensing the living) so that the many badges it surrounds itself with
won’t distract it. The creature leaves its cave each night to find those who
serve the law. Their bodies are stuffed into the coffins in the creature’s lair,
their badges battered and hung up in shame.

Justice is Blind . . . and Dead

An ocean cave leading into the dark tunnels beneath Kutchaven reeks
of rotting fish, seaweed and salt. A thin ledge of rocks leads into the cave.
The rocks are wet and smooth from the constant waves battering the
stone. The interior of the cavern is humid, the smell of death even worse.
The ledge turns into a rocky tunnel about 500 feet into the cave. This
tunnel travels nearly a quarter mile into the darkness before it opens into
a tomb-like cavern. The forgotten tomb contains coffins that are bolted to
the walls. The wooden coffins rise nearly 30 feet above the floor. Bones
dangle from many of the oldest coffins, the rotting wood releasing their
skeletal occupants. Coins (nearly 200 gp total) lie scattered across the
rocks beneath many of the coffins. Dangling from many of the coffins are
badges, crowns and other symbols of authority. Most of these badges of
office are scratched and deformed, as if they had been hammered against
the stone.
The cavern is the home of Jelida Daribe, a vile killer who attacked
villages in the dead of night – and left none alive to tell of his foul deeds.
Jelida was eventually caught and convicted, but the relatives of his victims
tore him apart shortly after his trial. Jelida returned as an eyeless filcher.

The Hungering Vines lives in darkness, with a ravenous hunger that can
only be satiated by blood and flesh. This creature resembles a writhing mass
of vines coming together at a trunk, supported by 4 huge roots. Many eyestalks jut from the trunk, peering about for food; Fal-yoth is almost never
surprised. The vines pull fresh carrion under its roots, where there is a huge
mouth that consumes the plant’s victims. Fal-yoth can move surprisingly
fast in a shambling gait, once it pulls its roots from the ground or rock into
which it has settled. It takes 1 round for its vines to push it from the earth
and allow it to move. Fal-yoth attacks any and all creatures that stray within
reach of its vines (10ft) for 1d8 damage, or will twist its vines into a sort of
“tail,” which can batter a single target for a colossal 4d10 points of damage.
Any target hit by the “tail” will be knocked down and backward 1d4x10ft.
If a weapon successfully hits Fal-yoth, the creature’s corrosive sap spatters
the weapon and destroys it. Magical weapons are permitted a saving throw.
Fal-yoth can also generate a sphere of darkness within 30’ that lasts 1d4
rounds, every 10 minutes. Fal-yoth is partially immune to lightning attacks,
taking half normal damage from such attacks. A saving throw is required each
combat round to resist the horror of the hunger radiating from Fal-yoth. If a
character fails his save, he is paralyzed by horror and unable to act that round.
It may be that more than one of these creatures exist, but only one is known.

The Walking Hedge

A tall, gaunt man named Carestru (fighter 6) stands outside the stone gates
of Folsan Downs, a small walled hamlet in the Juniper Forest. He carries a
bone-handled scythe, and wears tight-fitting leather that makes him seem even
thinner than his gaunt frame should allow. A brown cloak spills off his narrow
shoulders, but barely falls to his waist because of his height. He speaks in a
deep voice as he tells PCs to declare any plants, shrubs, fruits or vegetables, and

wooden weapons (such as staves or maces with wooden handles) that they carry.
Iron racks sitting outside the town’s wall hold weapons, but he chops up plants
and other items with his scythe. Inside the 10-foot-tall stone walls, the villagers
live off a diet of meat, fish and grains. No vegetables or fruits are allowed inside
the town’s borders. The villagers also burned and salted a 300-foot-wide swath
of ground around the wall, and keep the area clear of trees and vegetation.
A frantic mother meets PCs once they are allowed to enter the gates. She
weeps openly and falls to the ground as she pleads for any information about
“Little Stephan.” Her son snuck out of the walled community this morning and
hasn’t come home yet. With dusk fast approaching, the woman screams with
anguish at the thought of her child in the woods alone. No one in the village
is willing to go into the woods this close to sundown. The villagers fear the
Juniper Forest growing abundantly around them, and speak of the dread nights
before the wall went up when the “walking hedge” snatched unwary villagers
from their homes. The villagers should be scared. A hungering vine walks the
woods, looking to snare people out after dark. Little Stephan is currently hiding
in a lean-to he built in the forest. The scared little boy tries to stay silent, but his
noises have already attracted the attention of the dread Falshantog-Yoth.

Felikaur were magically bred from tigers in ancient times, as a battlebeast of the feuding noble houses. Some escaped into the wild and
flourished. The felikaur looks like a massive tiger, but with overlapping
horn plates instead of fur. They have large bat-like wings sprouting from
the shoulders, and a spiky tail. These creatures are intelligent enough to
prepare ambushes and use their surroundings to tactical advantage; in
the wild, they leap from cover to cover while attacking. In a gladiatorial
arena, they are able to take advantage of pit traps, spikes, barriers, or other
such tactical obstacles.
A felikaur’s tail spikes deal little damage, but secrete a paralysing toxin.
They can also pick up a human or smaller foe, carry it into the air for a
few rounds, and drop it from a height of 20 to 60 feet. Lastly, the felikaur
can spit a glob of corrosive acid to a distance of 20 feet, for 1d6 to 3d6
damage (in any given day, the available stomach acid permits a total of
9 dice of potential damage). This acid will eat through and ruin clothing,
non-magical armor, backpack straps, etc, in 1 round. The means by which
the ancients controlled and tamed these beasts is unknown - they cannot
be trained.

Tunnels Cats

A coliseum of piled black stones rises in the middle of the rocky wastes
of the Angern Badlands. The arena was abandoned long ago when the
Stark River was rerouted by a magical experiment gone awry. The river
slices through the open-air coliseum, splitting it in two. The rushing water
flooded the bowl where gladiators once fought, creating a large pond
with stone seats rising around it. One of the massive stone walls also fell
inward, creating a dangerous path of crumbled stones and shattered debris
breaking the water’s surface. A body is caught in the rushing water, the
corpse pressed against a sharp outcropping of rock in the middle of the
flowing river. The body is caught on a rock in the middle of the river and
requires four jumps across angled stones to get to it. Anyone trying to
jump from stone to stone must make a saving throw with each leap or fall
into the water. Anyone swept into the current takes 1d6 points of damage
as they are slammed against underwater stones. They can attempt another
saving throw to pull themselves out of the water each round.
The body is a dead adventurer placed there by 4 felikaurs that live in
empty tunnels carved into the hillside where gladiators once lived, ate and
trained. Empty weapon racks stand against the walls in some rooms, and
tables are broken into kindling. The few doors that remain are heavily
scratched and have wood peeling away in long, curling ribbons. Several
tunnels contain raised portcullises the felikaur can lower to trap and
separate creatures. The felikaur take advantage of the darkness within the
tunnels to surprise prey. A felikaur sentry always watches the body in the
river. The great cats sometimes fly out to attack people standing on the
shifting stones.
A partially devoured mule in one tunnel room has a saddle with pouches
that contain a map of the desert, 140 gp, a silver badge and a stuffed
turkey doll.

Orange-furred and bushy-tailed with large ears and multiple limbs, the
Ferec is a mutated fox. It has a long body, with four pairs of legs, and a
centaur-like humanoid torso with two pairs of arms. Despite its creative
intelligence and expansive vocabulary, the ferec is excitable, superstitious,
and easily distracted. It excels in various forms of craftsmanship, and
enjoys puzzling out the workings of traps, puzzle boxes, unusual weapons,
or other such contraptions. The heightened senses of a ferec, including
superior night vision and heightened hearing, ensure it will never be

The Unsolvable Solution

A 20-foot-diameter brass plate is inset into the floor of this stark
dungeon room. Elaborate sigils are engraved on thousands of movable
plates attached to the brass disc’s face. Each sigil can be twisted, turned
and slid across the flat surface to form larger symbols. The entire disc is
hot to the touch. Three iron stakes are driven into the stone floor around
the edges of the disc. Chained to the stakes are 3 ferecs. Each ferec wears
a collar linked to a 20-foot-long chain allows the creatures access to the
brass plate but not enough room to escape.
The ferecs are prisoners of Mottle Krackikak, a hezrou demon who
seeks to end the world. The brass plate is known as the Unbound Cyphrica,
the puzzle of a thousand solutions. Mottle wants to unlock the puzzle to
set about the end of the world, but he couldn’t solve the complicated
cipher on his own. He captured the ferecs and forced them to solve the
riddle for him. The ferecs’ paws are badly burned after days working on
the hot metal surface as they limp back and forth across the heated metal.
The ferecs solved the enigma days ago, but are stalling in the hope rescue
arrives soon.

Flensers are undead creatures with the same appearance as ghouls, but
wearing cloaks made of rotting skins, mainly those of humans – although
if the flenser has not encountered humans or their kin recently, it may
have resorted to adorning itself with the skins of animals. Flensers are
considerably more intelligent than ghouls, and may be found leading
ghoul packs.
Flensers have a 50% chance to be leading a pack of 2d6 ghouls, with a
25% chance that there are also 1d2 ghasts in the group. Like ghouls, the
claws and bite of a flenser can induce paralysis, but the flenser’s paralysis
is extremely powerful – the saving throw against it is made at a penalty of
-4 on the saving throw, and elves are not immune to the effects. If a flenser
kills a foe, it skins the corpse before eating the flesh, and adds the skin to
its hideous cloak.

Vrinnor the Skinner

A wooden door sits in a small hillock near the stone foundation of a
collapsed home. The wooden door creaks loudly if opened. Rickety stairs
lead 30 feet downward to a packed dirt floor. Skeletons lie in and on the
dirt, while others are manacled to the cellar’s stone walls. Normal rats
gnaw the bones, stripping them of flesh and muscle. Mold grows on the
bones and across the floor. Tangled tree roots push through the cellar walls.
A wooden frame in the corner has a pale sheet of human flesh stretched
across it to cure. Various knives and sharp picks hang from sharp hooks
on the wall.
The cellar belongs to Vrinnor, a flenser known to the superstitious
villagers of Folsan Downs as “The Skinner” because of the state of his
victims when they are found. The undead creature leads 6 ghouls that
roam the Juniper Forest. The ghouls drag travellers back to the cellar and
hand them over to Vrinnor to skin. The ghouls get what’s left after Vrinnor
completes his grisly task. Vrinnor sleeps in a bed of human-skin sheets
under the stairs leading down into the cellar. Vrinnor is frequently absent
from his abattoir seeking prey on his own. He normally leaves 2 ghouls to
watch the entrance at all times. The ghouls hide in the collapsed ruins and
summon Vrinnor when someone enters his killing ground.

A flowerchild resembles a mass of flowers that can shape itself in any
way it desires, from a carpet to a roughly humanoid form. It does not
make any sort of physical attack, but anyone coming within 50ft of one
of these plants has walked into considerable danger. The area around the
flowerchild has a sweet smell that causes anyone breathing it to become
utterly peaceful and uninterested in taking any action other than to sleep
(a successful saving throw allows the victim to shake off this effect). The
magically-induced lassitude is permanent unless the victim is brought
out of the flowerchild’s scent. Once it has a helpless victim nearby, the
flowerchild will release a cloud of pollen that causes a victim to make
a saving throw every three rounds while exposed. If the saving throw
fails, the victim becomes a planting-ground for the flowerchild seeds. The
victim will begin transforming into a flowerchild, with the transformation
becoming complete after 1d3+2 days. A cure disease spell will end the
infection by killing the pollen.
Flowerchildren are immune to blunt weapons and piercing weapons.

Orc and Unicorn

A strange sight awaits PCs in this peaceful vale: A unicorn kneels
amid a carpet of pink flowers, its head down and its eyes closed in sleep.
An orc wearing animal skins brushes the unicorn’s flowing mane with a
comb made from a squirrel’s rib cage. The orc smiles and hums softly to
himself. The flowers sway in the breeze, their fragrant pollen rising in the
wind. The orc wears a wreath of lilacs and asters on its head. More flowers
decorate the unicorn’s golden mane and tail.
The orc and unicorn stumbled separately into a flowerchild patch
spreading across this peaceful clearing. The flowerchild’s pollen
overwhelmed both creatures, causing them to sink down among the
colorful blooms in tranquil, mindless bliss. The unicorn is near death,
with flowers starting to grow from its skin. The orc is holding out, but
won’t last more than a couple of days. If the flowerchild is killed, the orc
and unicorn wake slowly. They flee into the woods once they regain their
senses.

Beautiful Evil

A flower-covered marble bier stands in the middle of an idyllic glen.
Butterflies fly in colorful formations through the honey-scented air.
Rabbits hop innocently through the verdant grass. A statue of a lovely
woman wearing flowing robes stands beside the bier. Flowers wrap
around the lifelike sculpture, twining about her lithe figure. A plaque at the
base of the statue reads “Lady Evellis. May she find peace in nature that
eluded her in life.” A 15-foot-diameter circle of fragrant flowers surrounds
the bier.
The bier is a flat marble slab supported by two round columns. A
blanket of colourful flowers completely covers the magical glass bubble
protecting Lady Evellis’ body. The flowers are magically treated so they
never wilt or decay. Lady Evellis’ body is similarly preserved. She is a
beautiful woman wearing a gold crown (2,000 gp) on her head. Anyone
taking the crown suffers horribly as everything seems to go wrong (the
PC suffers a –5 penalty to saving throws, straps break on his clothing at
inopportune times, people he meets are hostile, etc.).
The wide carpet of blooming flowers growing around the bier is a
flowershroud. The flowershroud normally exists on forest animals that
blunder into it, but it also recently killed the glen’s elderly caretaker. His
brittle bones lie beneath the shroud, pressed into the soft earth.

As its name suggests, the Giant Flying Jellyfish is a marine life form
that has adapted to existence in the skies. It is a hazard to sky-travelers
and flying creatures, as it is almost translucent and is also known to hide
in clouds. The giant flying jellyfish is partially gaseous in nature, and
flies by means of jetting air. The giant flying jellyfish attacks by trailing
its tentacles onto the decks of ships, into the space occupied by flying
opponents, or through settlements when it hunts across the ground. It can
make up to 2 attacks per 10ft cubic space occupied by opponents, to a
maximum of 8 attacks. Each tentacle causes 2d6 damage, and may cause
paralysis lasting 1d4 days (saving throw negates). It has also evolved a
distinctive defence against magic. Any spell or similar attack against it
builds up a charge in the creature, if it makes its saving throw. This charge
is equal to 1 point per spell level, to a maximum equal to the jellyfish’s hit
dice. In any round, in addition to making tentacle attacks, the giant flying
jellyfish can discharge from 1 to 4 energy charges with the following
effects: (1) All spell-casting beings within 50ft suffer intense mental
distress for 1d3 rounds per charge, making it impossible to cast spells
during this time. (2) All creatures and vessels flying via magic within 30ft
have their movement rate halved for a period of 2 rounds per charge. (3)
All creatures within 10ft of the giant flying jellyfish suffer -1 to all die
rolls per charge expended for 1d2 turns. If severely threatened, the giant
flying jellyfish may expend a blast of 8 charges, with effects as if 4 charges
had been expended, but doubling the effective ranges of the blast’s effects.
This massive expenditure of power also allows the jellyfish to quadruple
its flying movement rate for 4 rounds in order to escape. Most specimens
are 20-40ft in diameter, with 40-80ft long tentacles. Larger versions, of 24
or even 32 HD, may also exist, particularly in the ethereal realities or in
the voids between the moons.

The Hovering Horde

Screams of terror roll through the streets of Aurellia as people race
past the Tavern of the One-Eyed Goat. Elves, humans and dwarves
look over their shoulders as they race away in fear. Flying through the
air behind the runners are nearly 30 figures that hover at various heights
over the city’s rooftops. Besides the hovering figures, others slide across
the ground, leaving bloody trails as they scoot along. Still more rise and
fall ominously, sometimes slamming into roofs face-first before being
dragged mercilessly across the sharp stucco tiles. Blood trickles down
the slack features of many of the hovering men and women. A few twitch
uncontrollably as they float.
A group of three elves facing the oncoming beings twitch and spin, then
rise into the air to join the hovering horde. The flying bodies are harmless,
and for the most part, quite dead. Each was caught up in the tentacle mass
hanging beneath a giant flying jellyfish. The floating jellyfish hunts above
the rooftops, dragging its long tentacles over anything unfortunate enough
to be below it. It recently overturned a sticky honeybee hive owned by an
eccentric mage named Fadzien. The mage was testing ways to increase the
stickiness of the bee’s honey. The jellyfish’s tentacles are now coated in

A moose charges through the trees of Kilnmass Glen, swinging its wide

branches in pursuit of the moose are 40 carnivorous flying squirrels. The
squirrels glide down to bite the poor moose as it tries to escape. After they
attack, the squirrels scamper back into the trees to leap down again. The
riled up squirrels attack any creatures that gets in their way of bringing

Flytrap shamblers are mobile plants about the bulk of a horse, but
they shuffle along the ground on thick, tentacle-like vines. The body is
leafy and sometimes blooms with orchid-like flowers; the head rises on
a fibrous stalk topped with the wide mouth of a venus flytrap, which can
deliver a powerful bite. It is common for them to carry a polearm or spear
in their front vines, for they can use such weapons in tandem with the bite.
Despite their appearance, flytrap shamblers are relatively intelligent and
often posted as guards by villains with the ability to control plants. Their
value in this sort of role is somewhat compromised by the fact that they
cannot talk.
Flytrap shamblers are capable of seeding themselves, but are almost
always found as a result of direct cultivation by powerful villains who
possess the knowledge and skill to breed such vegetation. The creation of
a flytrap shambler involves magic, alchemy, and the skillful cultivation
of several different flowering plants, some of which are not commonly
found. There are manuals and librams describing the process, but these are
for the most part forgotten lore.
The leafy body of a flytrap shambler is immune to damage from piercing
weapons, but cutting and bludgeoning weapons inflict normal damage.

Welcome to the Grotto

The Mushroom Grotto is an underground greenhouse ruled by the
Fungus Druid Angus Sallow. The greenhouse has a central circular
chamber and six 50-foot-long spokes radiating outward into the damp
earth. A central pool of clear water is filled with clinging vines of ivy and
wet, spongy plants. Moss and mushrooms grow in the side passages. Each
hall is lit by blue lichens that glow feebly along the walls and across the
ceiling in a cascade of color. Rows of planters sit along the entrances to
the tunnels.
The ever-changing Fungus Druid has lived among his plants for so long

The Fox Monk is a short fox-like humanoid, garbed in a shabby, quilted
robe and bearing only a begging bowl and walking stick. Fox monks have
taken vows of poverty and transience; they rely upon charity for food and
somewhere to sleep, never staying in one area for more than a few days.
They may defend themselves with a bite (1d4 damage), or in unarmed
combat. A fox monk’s strike causes the target’s nervous system to spasm,
causing him to drop any items held and move at half normal speed for 1d4
rounds (saving throw negates). Fox monks may also forego all attacks to
perform dodging leaps, causing enemies to attack at -3 to hit. Lastly, a fox
monk can cast Protection from Evil and Purify Food and Drink once per
day. Despite their vows, these pious beggars are considered troublemakers
by most civilized folk.

Sounds, no Silence

The Tainted Mule Tavern in the center of the village of Hoggins is
a pleasant place, with low prices, nice rooms and good ale on tap. The
owner, Mather Smits, a burly ex-fighter who nurses a noticeable limp,
happily serves newcomers piles of food as he regales them with stories of
his past exploits and the town’s history. Oddly, he throws in wax earplugs
to anyone renting a room for the night. Shortly after sunset, a massive iron
bell in the bell tower of an abandoned temple to Voard begins chiming
the hours. The loud gonging echoes throughout the village, making sleep
nearly impossible. The bell chimes until sunrise.
A fox monk named Candric Tuffletail recently arrived in town,
following a dream that told him to head west to the small town. The Voard
worshipper climbed into the bell tower and sleeps there during the day. At
night, he serves a penance known only to him by ringing the bell to mark
the hours of the night. The monk refuses to leave the tower until he has
sated the dead god Voard. Anyone trying to physically remove him faces
an angry monk very capable of protecting himself.

Red of Tooth and Claw

A collapsed 100-foot-tall tower lies on its side, partially submerged in
the Sin Mire Swamp. Bubbles burst around the sunken stones. Brackish
water fills half of the empty round tunnel leading into the tower’s sideways
interior. The collapsed base of the wall has a large, blackened hole blasted
through the stone, the obvious reason why it fell. Bullfrogs croak in the
reeds growing wildly throughout the swamp. Catfish swim in and out of
the collapsed tower. A dead and partially devoured alligator floats belly up
atop the murky water. A few bright red teeth are still stuck in the gator’s
thick hide.
The tower belonged Cornelisa Blent, a mage who experimented
with – and on – various unfortunate inhabitants of the ever-expanding
swamp. Her last experiment (and the one that spelled doom for her and
her tower home) turned an army of giant frogs into deadly killers. As her
experiments overwhelmed her, she blasted apart one of the tower’s walls
in the hope of escaping. The explosion weakened the structure, causing it
to topple. Cornelisa died in the fall, but the 12 giant killer frogs escaped
unharmed. The amphibians live inside the fallen tower, eating the fish,
giant dragonflies and alligators that live in the area. The frogs hop wildly
out of the tower toward anyone approaching the opening. Cornelisa’s
experiment turned all of the frogs’ teeth and claws a bright red.

In ages past, some mad experimenter created a golem from frog-flesh:
the ancestor of all froglums. Some frog genes, however, can switch
genders and even produce hermaphrodites. The ancestor of froglums was
likely the first (and probably the only) self-breeding golem. Froglums
are huge bipeds virtually identical to their shared ancestor: eight feet
tall with slimy green skin, webbed feet, and great frog-like eyes. Their
legs resemble those of frogs, but are much shorter and allow the froglum
to stand upright. These creatures are soulless, having been bred from
an unnatural and artificial origin. They have no detectable thoughts. In
general, they serve any chaotic master, especially one who resembles a
frog or a powerful wizard. They are seldom found acting on their own
volition, for it is in their nature to follow a powerful master. A froglum’s
slimy skin makes it resistant to fire (half damage).

The Frog Prince Bandit

A tall, thin young man with a scraggly yellow beard steps out from
behind a stand of cedar trees. He wears a strange green helmet on his head.
The helmet has large white eyes painted on the sides, making it look like a
squashed frog’s head. He demands 200 gp from travelers using the “Frog
Prince’s Highway.” Those who pay are allowed to go on their way. Those
who refuse face the prince’s protector: an eight-foot-tall froglum loyal to
the odd-looking young man.
Urdek Longface was a down-on-his-luck, run-of-the-mill bandit until
he discovered his odd helmet. When he put it on, he found himself face
to face with a froglum willing to do his every command. The froglum is
bound to the helmet and willingly serves whoever wears it. Urdek flees
combat, and does all he can to protect his precious headgear. He doesn’t
want to return to nothingness. He carries a belt pouch with 600 gp in it.
The gold was taken from travelers too scared to fight the froglum.

The Fungal Creeper is a patch of fungus growing upon a boulder or
wall, which often appears weathered and strangely corroded. The name
comes from its ability to creep along the wall, moving about to follow
living creatures. Fungal creepers draw sustenance from minerals found
in rock and stone, but supplement their diets with fresh blood. The fungal
creeper can sense the warmth of life within 60ft, and reacts by moving
closer. It attacks by sinking tiny root-like appendages into exposed flesh,
latching on to cause continuous damage if the attack roll is a 19 or 20.
It may be distracted by fresh meat, whether in the form of rations no
more than 1 day old or the body of an unconscious combatant. They are
scavengers, and will move to feed off carrion as soon as it is detected.

Nail Fungus

A weathered statue stands beside the entry into this circular room. A
round dais in the center of the low-ceilinged chamber is made of marble
trimmed with brass. A giant stone hand (with fingers fully six feet long)
rises from the center of the dais. It stands on what would be the stump of
its wrist. Its nails are pitted and covered with patchy green moss. In its
open palm is a mace with a silver head and leather-wrapped handle. A
skeleton lies on the floor before the hand, its torso crushed.
The giant hand is a stone golem molded into this unique shape. It
clamps its fingers down on anyone trying to remove the mace, and then
flips over to scuttle about on its fingertips. The golem slams people aside
by flicking them out of its way with its long fingers. A fungal creeper
covers the stone fingers, co-existing with the golem. Anyone hit by the
golem is also attacked by the creeper as it latches onto the PC’s skin.
The mace is a +2 mace with the ability to do an additional 1d6 points of

Animal trails crisscross through the thick underbrush, and other dead

All of them bear discolored spots of decomposition. A path cut by loggers
runs parallel to the game trails. It winds around some of the bigger trees.
Growing among the shaded roots of the elm trees are 12 violet fungi.

A furious fountain resembles a large anthropomorphic stone fountain,
usually spraying a jet of water from its mouth. These creatures are
similar to golems, but the animating spirit within is an imprisoned water
elemental.
When standing still, a furious fountain is indistinguishable from any
ordinary fountain. A furious fountain may attack with its stony fist, or with
a jet of water. The animate fountain can spew out a violent stream of water
at a range of 200ft, three times per day. The target suffers 3d10 points
of damage, and is pushed back the full remaining distance of the jet’s
range (a successful save halves both the damage and the distance pushed
back). A second saving throw allows the victim to remain standing and
avoid dropping any items held in hand. Like golems, furious fountains are
unaffected by non-magical weapons. These magical creatures can only be
affected by spells that specifically target water or stone, with appropriate
results to be determined by the referee. As a guideline, the fountain will
lose, at most, 4d10 hit points from such spells; Part Water would be an
example of a spell that might inflict such damage.

The Harem’s Bath

The comely women of Caliph Anastior’s harem lounge around a marble
fountain spraying water nearly 20 feet into the air. Water falls like rain
on the beautiful women as they relax on plush red cushions and low
silver couches about the fountain’s wide basin. They eat plump grapes
and succulent dates from large ceramic bowls. Each woman wears a thin
veil and a thinner gown. Their eyes are rimmed in black, and red rouge
brightens their cheeks.
The caliph is a peaceful man, but also very paranoid. His biggest fear is
to lose his harem, and the suspicious man fears thieves lurk around every
corner and under every flowering plant. He knows they are just waiting to
steal away the women with whom he shares his palatial estate. Walking
the garden are 6 tigers, but the true protector is a furious fountain hiding
in plain sight inside the harem’s chamber. The fountain rises from its
resting spot to attack any male PCs who enter unbidden into the women’s
ornate chambers. The fountain is careful to avoid injuring the women as
it stands and fights.

Chasing Waterfalls

As one leaves the tangled woodlands for the scrub-covered foothills of
the green mountains, they are drawn toward a narrow defile from which
flows a quick, silvery river. The defile is difficult to enter, for the water
flows quickly, and there are no ledges upon which one can walk. Over the
centuries, adventurers have pounded numerous iron spikes into the walls,
using them to secure ropes to make the passage a bit safer.
Once one has breached the defile, ledges appear over the river, which
slows a bit. One can see blood red fish, almost eel-like in shape, flittering
through the clear waters and gathering in the pools, which are caked with
a jade green algae. The river and narrow canyon extend 12 miles into the
foothills, the walls of the canyon growing taller and taller, and eventually
bathing the canyon in a glorious, ever-present shadow that chills the air.
At the end of this canyon there is a waterfall, about 200 feet tall, and
a pool surrounded by mists and caked with that same jade green algae.
The waterfall drops into a basin carved from the surrounding green stone.
This basin is 30 feet tall and ringed by grotesque gargoyles, from whose
mouths pours the waters of the river – from all save one. This gargoyle’s
mouth is stoppered by a large piece of amber (worth 500 gp) wrapped in
a bit of leopard skin and enclosed within a leather sack. One must reach
their arm well into the mouth of the gargoyle to reach this parcel, and
surely one must wonder if the beast is alive and poised to strike.
The stoppered gargoyle is not alive, but 4 gargoyles do lurk here,
hiding in a cave behind the falling water, about 30 feet above the top of
the basin. They are the guardians of the falls, and the mysteries that lie
behind them on a tangled plateau of magnolias and tree-ferns reachable
through the gargoyle’s cave.

Faces in the Crowd

An immense underground cavern here hosts a temple carved from
the living rock and hidden behind astounding curtains, 60 feet high,
composed of copper wire and the carapaces of giant ants. Behind these
curtains, one finds a wall of bas-reliefs – the outer wall of the temple.
The lowest portion of the wall is carved with tusked giants, holding aloft
platforms while serpents slither about their legs. On these platforms sat
grand nymphs swathed in diaphanous silk, fanned by sylphs and served
by satyrs. Behind them stand terrible hags with scowling faces, their noses
hooked, their eyes leering. Between those leering heads are a number of
demons, crouching and holding in their hands vicious hooked spears. A
few of the demons are actually 3 maggog gargoyles, the guardians of the
subterranean Temple of Azathoth.

The gas spore is a spherical, chitin-armored sac containing fungus
spores, about five feet in diameter, with some moving tendrils growing

allow it to float in the air, and it can move by expelling some of these gases
in a form of jet-propulsion. When it is near any warm-blooded creatures,
it will move toward them by instinct: these creatures are completely nonintelligent.
If a gas spore gets close enough to touch a living creature, it will inject
spores into the target with a successful to-hit roll. If the victim fails a
saving throw, these spores will bloat and transform the host into 1d6+1
new gas spores within 24 hours unless a cure disease spell is used to
prevent this (rather disgusting) transformation.
Moreover, when a gas spore is killed (and it is designed by nature
to burst easily), it explodes in a radius of 20ft, inflicting 6d6 points of
damage in that area (half damage with a successful saving throw). The
body of anyone killed by the blast will also begin transforming into new
gas spores.

Going for a Spin

Adventurers find themselves in a large cavern with smooth walls, floor
and ceiling. The cavern is roughly circular, and the only inhabitants are
a 12 gas spores, floating about the place aimlessly. The cavern has two
exits, other than the tunnel through which the adventurers enter. Floating
in the middle of the cavern is a large sphere, apparently made of white
marble swirled with light greys and blues. Touching this sphere reveals
the truth, as the temporal stasis that held this rather enraged air elemental
suddenly ends. The air elemental wastes little time in forming a whirlwind
that throws the gas spores around the room. Each person in the room must
make a saving throw or be struck by a gas spore as they spin and whirl
about the chamber.

Getting it Wrong Gets it Right

Somewhere in a forgotten dungeon there is a vault of brass. The walls
are brass and covered with clever little decorations of crosses and cubes.
The floors are clad in brass tiles. And one wall holds a large, heavy brass
door with a large locking mechanism held in what appears to be the head
of a dragon.
The locking mechanism is not especially difficult to work, but it is a
trap. To open the lock, one must trip what, to any knowledgeable thief,
would appear to be the incorrect tumblers. If one succeeds at an open
locks roll, they hear a loud clank! from within the vault, and feel the
floor vibrate and rattle for a moment. A second successful open locks roll
causes a metallic moan to sound through the walls and floor and ends in
another clank! A third successful roll causes the floor tile directly in front
of the lock to collapse, sending the thief 20 feet down into the waiting
expanse of a gelatinous cube. The cube inhabits a network of limestone
catacombs, and it is not alone.
Two unsuccessful open lock rolls, on the other hand, cause the vault
door to noiselessly swing open. Within, one finds the following treasure:
1,000 silver coins (decorated with crescents and stars), 200 gold coins
(bearing the profile of Queen Sarvasti of the Three Eyes), a golden yak
worth 50 gp (gold foil around carved bone), a grey-brown cloak (worth 5
sp), a belt of red dragon hide (worth 30 gp) and a rowan lyre that, when
the correct tune is played, ejects a vial of basilisk blood.

Ghastly Choice

While one is foolishly crawling through the underworld, they might
come across a tunnel, the entrance of which is carved to resemble the
gaping mouth of a tiger, with eye sockets that hold blue-green orbs of
metal. Beyond there is a tunnel, the entire length of which is hung with
iron masks on iron chains, the masks representing stoic matrons with full
cheeks and empty eyes. At the end of this tunnel lies the grand cavern of
the ghasts, an immense void filled with the stench of decay and thousands
upon thousands of cast off bones.
Those bones that retain gibbets of flesh are crawling with rot grubs.
Narrow paths between the bone mounds wind through the cavern, and
these paths are crawling with ghasts, their cloven hooves clicking on the
bare stone of the cavern floor, their vulgar jests filling the noisome air.
A massive column of stone rises from the floor of the cavern and reaches
the ceiling. The column looks like two cones that touch at the points, and
is 30 feet wide at its most narrow point. The column is 200 feet tall and its
base is piled high with bones, for the ghasts appear to avoid the column,
never approaching within 30 feet of it. A secret door at the base of the
column allows one to enter the column, where they will find a spiral stair
that climbs all the way up the column to a more pleasant cavern of slimes
that evoke wondrous hallucinations that masquerade as communiqués of
the gods.

Ghosts

There are innumerable types of ghosts with varying qualities, often depending on the nature and circumstances
under which the person died. One example follows.

Ghost, Strangling

These apparitions are similar to banshees, but instead of screeching
they can attack only a single opponent at a time, strangling the victim
with insubstantial hands. If the attack hits, the victim must make a saving
throw or die within 1d4+1 rounds. A remove curse spell will break the
creature’s hold during this time period. Protection from evil spells will
hold these creatures at bay. Anyone strangled by a strangling ghost will
rise as a strangling ghost within 1d6 days.

Don’t Go Down Strangler’s Alley

Local folks will say, time and time again, that you avoid Strangler’s
Alley at night, no matter what. Despite the rumors about a treasure in the
old house at the end of the alley, a treasure one can only find in moonlight,
one never enters the alley at night. Prepare for adventurers to ignore this
advice.
The alley is ordinary enough. The ground is earth – hard and dry
usually, but mucky to a depth of one foot in the rain. It is about 5 feet wide
and flanked by two buildings, one an inn composed of red brick (with no
windows on this side) and the other a counting house with one story of cut
stone and the upper stories composed of wattle-and-daub. Both buildings
are four stories tall. At the end of the alley there is a wrought-iron gate
and a small courtyard filled with an overgrown garden. A small fountain,
now dry, stands there, its playful nymph covered in vines, one of her arms
cracked. Beyond the garden there is a manse that wraps around, touching
the inn and counting house. It is three stories tall and built of black brick
and wood, with a steep roof of copper tile and bronze ornamentation
(now green with age) around the windows and doors. At night, the alley
is haunted by 3 strangling ghosts, a trio of assassins who were cut down
by mysterious means after leaving the manse one dark and stormy night.
They had killed the inhabitant, a sorceress of no little influence in the
courts of Hell (where she is said to rule to this day).

Ghouls are pack-hunting undead corpse eaters. They are immune, like

Ghouls’ Night Out

In the citadel of the necromancer-king, ghouls are kept on short chains
and taunted with bits of flesh by the passing acolytes and the children of
the grandees of the court who stroll there swathed in their black togas and
tunics of silver links, their ebony walking sticks and slippers of volcanic
glass tip-tapping along the uneven pavements. At night, when all are
secure behind their thick, iron doors, the ghouls are loosed from their
chains and roam freely, cleaning the streets of carrion and delving into
secret places only they know, to count their hidden treasures and make
their secret plans.

Ghoul, Crimson
Hit Dice: 4
Armor Class: 6 [13]
Attacks: 2 claws (1d3) and 1 bite (1d6)

Crimson ghouls are created by strange and terrible magical procedures
worked by necromancers upon a normal ghoul. They are not ordinarily
found in the wild, as regular ghouls are, although from time to time a pack
of crimson ghouls might outlive or escape from their masters. In this case,
the crimson ghouls will be found in the same sorts of desolate or cursed
spots as normal ghouls, even competing with them for the horrid, charnel
foods they crave. As with normal ghouls, the touch of a crimson ghoul
causes paralysis for 3d6 turns unless the victim makes a saving throw.
As one might expect from the name, crimson ghouls have hides the
color of blood. They otherwise resemble normal ghouls, although they
are stronger and have a more powerful bite. In addition to the skin color
and a more robust physical frame than their ghoulish brethren, crimson
ghouls have another signal distinction from a normal ghoul, which is that
normal weapons only inflict half damage against them. Magical weapons
inflict full damage. Moreover, crimson ghouls are somewhat resistant to
spells: they gain a +1 bonus on saving throws against any spell. As with
most undead, they are immune to sleep spells, but they can be affected
by a charm person or a charm monster spell (although the duration of the
charm is extremely short, not lasting more than 1d6 rounds). This strange
vulnerability seems to be the result of the necromantic procedures by
which they are prepared, a by-product of being created as loyal servants
to their necromantic masters.

Crimson Guardians

In a dungeon somewhere in the humid south, there is an infamous room
of red stone. The room is circular, and decorated with dozens of roiling,
flapping tapestries that depict a ghoulish feast, from start to finish. In the
room’s center there is a strange curtain of wavering, orange light – as
one enters, they might first mistake it for flames – that rises from floor to
ceiling and encompasses a 30-foot-diameter area. Within, one might catch
glimpses of nine figures, as red as newly spilled blood, moving about.
The curtains are part of an anti-magic field. Within, there is an iron chest
with nine fiendishly clever locks (and traps – each one a poison that robs
a thief of dexterity and imposes a –5% to all open locks rolls). The chest
is guarded by 9 crimson ghouls that will not likely have to face magic
weapons or spells within the anti-magic field. The chest actually contains
a shaft that bypasses the next dungeon level for the one below it.

Castle of the Cloud Bully

An old man in grey robes, a red cloak upon his shoulders, a tall grey
hat on his head, gladly offers a circlet of steel to any who offer a few
coins of gold. When one looks through this circlet, they see a wondrous
vault heaped high with gold and silver and, on a pedestal, a beautiful harp
plucked by a golden woman with hair of copper ringlets and eyes as green
as emeralds. One can reach through the circlet (it is about 7 inches in
diameter), but cannot reach the treasures, which are about 10 feet away.
Should anyone manage to shrink themselves and step through the
circlet, they find themselves in the floating castle of the cloud giant
Blunderbore, who rules over a family of 7 other cloud giants and a
kindly ogress called Alice who runs the kitchen and tends to the family’s
pet griffon, Zmert. Stepping through the circlet causes it to disappear,
so the trip is one way. Blunderbore dresses in the furs of a black bear and
wears a necklace of white stones and a red girdle around his waist. His
castle sits atop a dingy cloud that never rains, only blotting out the sun
over a farmland until his demand for ransom is paid. Blunderbore uses
his griffon to collect his ransom (mostly of foodstuffs, but also silver and
gold), and sometimes pelts villages with stones to make his point.

Daimyo Giants are perhaps improperly named: the term “Daimyo” is
ordinarily used as a title, whereas the daimyo giants are a particular subrace in their own right. However, they are so often found leading groups
of other giants (and ogres, as seen below) that the use of the title fits
them well. They tend to attract followings of other giant-type creatures,
for their charisma – to giant and ogre races only – is always treated as
18 regardless of the giant’s true charisma as it would affect members of
other races. Storm giants and titans are the exception to this rule; they not
only do not find daimyo giants to be more than normally charismatic, but
consider them to be irritatingly arrogant. Daimyo giants, for their part,
avoid territories claimed by a storm giant or a titan, although with enough
followers a daimyo giant might very well attempt to kill a storm giant.
Daimyo giants are slightly shorter but more powerfully muscled than
cloud giants. They tend to have blue, yellow, or reddish-orange skin
coloration, almost always with long, jet-black hair. They wield 10ft-long
two-handed swords, with which they gain a +1 bonus to hit (the swords
are not magical, merely well-honed). A daimyo giant will almost always
(70%) be found with a small force of giant-retainers (see below), and if
the giant does not have such a retinue it will be attended by 1d3+1 hill
giants.
01-20: 1d3 cloud giants
21-50: 1d6 frost giants or fire giants (depends on nearest appropriate terrain)
51-60: 1d2 cloud giants and 1d6+1 hill giants
61-70: 1d3 frost or fire giants and 1d6+1 hill giants
71-00: 1d10+2 hill giants
In addition to any giant followers present, a daimyo giant will always
have a retinue of ogre types in attendance: 1d3+1 ogre mages, 1d6+1
tusken ogres (q.v.), 1d6+4 ogres.
Daimyo giants are sometimes found occupying ancient ruins in the
deep jungle; these will not have retinues of giant followers, but will have
twice the normal number of ogre followers (of each type) and their lairs
will also be protected by predatory cats and carnivorous apes.

Race to the Top

At a high mountain pass, where two wide ledges meet, a band of
adventurers might come across another band of treasure hunters intent on
winning the pass and stopping competitors from reaching the ancient ruin
that lies above the tree line. These treasure hunters are 4 frost giants and
2 ogre magi under the command of a haughty daimyo giant clad from
head to toe in white dragon-hide armor. The group has traveled from their
lair in a crevasse many miles away to claim the prize that waits in the ruin,
a titaness with skin the color of newly fallen snow and eyes as icy as a
glacier, sleeping under a deific curse to awaken and fall in love with the
first giant to kiss her. Of course, the ruin holds many other treasures as
well that the daimyo giant’s retinue plan to claim.

Playing with Fire

As adventurers walk through a dark, secluded wood, they might come
across a large mirror propped against a tree. The frame is brass and
ornately worked. When a handsome male (charisma 13+) looks into the
mirror, two large hands reach through and grab him (surprise on 1-4 on
1d6, saving throw to resist if not surprised), dragging him through the
mirror and leaving naught but a cloud of acrid, black smoke in his place.
Just as suddenly, the mirror returns to normal, and it will not work as a
portal again.
The victim has been carried away to a distant volcano that rumbles
and spits in the distance (within sight). Here, a clan of fire giants keeps a
small fortress. The males are currently away, fighting the frost giants, so
the females seek a plaything to entertain them. The man will be wrestled
down and chained around the neck (though the chain is a pretty one).
His weapons and armor will be removed, of course. The giantesses are
gentle and treat their new toy well, offering him spiced wines and exotic
viands. In exchange for one year of servitude, they offer him a suit of
+1 chainmail that is so cunningly crafted as to make the wearer almost
immune to fire (50% resistance to damage, +2 to saving throw), or some
more suitable reward for characters who cannot wear such armor.

In a frozen wasteland of snow-covered mountains and frozen rivers,
the adventurers come across a roaring bonfire in a narrow defile. The
defile is not so narrow that one cannot move around the fire, but they
find this a moot point as 6 frost giants, waiting in ambush atop the walls
of the defile, suddenly rise and hurl a volley of boulders before leaping
down with their axes. They giants are waiting for hated fire giants, and
there might be a slim chance they do not attack, but it is more likely they
consider the adventurers spies and try to seize them for questioning.

House in the Hills

In a cave system within a hillock covered by lilac bushes, a family of
6 hill giants keeps house. The lady of the cave is brewing a cauldron of
treacle while her eldest daughters are tanning cave bear hides in vats of
urine. Father and the eldest son are out hunting, but the youngest son
has been left behind; he sits about 300 feet away from the cave entrance
knapping flint for spears. A swift stream runs beneath the cave, and
buckets on ropes are tossed out to retrieve water. The hill giants keep a
crude basin carved into the floor filled with the water. Deeper in the cave
there is a hearth with a chimney that reaches to the top of the hillock,
where it is covered by a grate. A large stone in the hearth is actually a
polymorphed magic-user called Cedric. He has been in rock form for

Khmornian giants are often found living in jungles, but they can be
found in virtually any non-arctic terrain. These giants have four arms, and
long tusks protruding from wide mouths. Their lairs are often guarded
(90% chance) by 1d4 giant pythons.
Khmornian giants can throw rocks at a range up to 200ft, inflicting
2d10 points of damage; if they are not using any of their four arms in
melee combat, these giants can hurl two such rocks per round.
The polyandrous female khmornian giants are found in a 1:3 ratio with
the males. Females have only 9 hit dice, but they are considerably more
dangerous than the males due to their spell casting and shapechanging
abilities. All females are shamans with the spell casting ability of a 4th
level cleric, and can shapeshift once per day into (and out of) a snakelike
hybrid form. The snake hybrid has no significant difference from the

The Maidens’ Well

A temple hemmed in by the jungle is home to a clan of 20 khmornian
giants, not to mention the 10 giant pythons they keep as pets and sentries.
1d4 of the giant pythons patrol the grounds around the temple, accessing
the subterranean levels inhabited by the giants via a well heavily carved
with serpent motifs. The female khmornians often move about the
surrounding lands as well, shapeshifted into luminous nymphs, seeking
males to lure to the temple with tearful pleas or pleasing songs. Once at
the temple, they guide people into what remains of the inner sanctum,
where an idol of a four-armed jungle god with a face like a parrot (a stone
golem) awaits new victims. The giantesses will flee, of course, though the
giants below can watch the struggle against the idol via a crystal-ball like
pool in the temple’s depths.

the work, aided by his priestesses (hill giant shamans) and his pet cave

Lost Love

A forlorn storm giant sits on the side of a lonely mountain that rises
from a vast desert dotted by ruins. This giant, Skadamere by name, lost
his lady love to Plexus of Ghant, the infamous enchanter, and has not
had the will to bring rain to the land for many years. The land is dying –
a few hardy shrubs and small trees have persisted on ground water, but
the grasses are gone, the herds have left, and the hunters and herdsmen
with them. One of the ruins dotting the land holds the ancient manse of
Plexus, and Skadamere would give almost anything to have it explored
and ransacked for a clue as to where he has fled with the fair Ulbinia.

Move: 9

Challenge Level/XP: 11/1,700
P’Nahki slugs are massive, translucent creatures. The only clearly
visible part of the slug’s anatomy is the disturbingly human-looking brain
suspended in the slug’s body, appearing at first glance to be floating in the
air. These creatures originated in a forgotten place called P’Nahk; whether
this was a ruined city, a lost world, or an entirely different dimension is
not known.
The giant slugs of P’Nahk are highly intelligent, although this intellect
is seldom put to use in a way that can be related to human motivation or
logic. All P’Nahki slugs have ESP ability. Three times per day, a giant
P’Nahki slug can issue forth a blast of insanity in a cone shape 60ft long,
expanding to a width of 60ft at the far end. Anyone within the area of the
blast must make a saving throw or be affected as follows:
01-25: frozen by fear for 1d4+1 rounds; the character will (and must)
fight back against a direct assault but can take no other action
26-50: insane rage for 1d4+1 rounds; the character attacks any former
allies in a frenzy of hatred
51-75: self-hatred for 1d4+1 rounds; the character drops any held items
and claws at his/her own body, inflicting 1hp of damage per round.
76-00: adoration for 1d4+1 rounds; the character drops all held items,
falls to the floor, and grovels in worship of the slug.
Because of their translucency, giant slugs of P’Nahk surprise opponents
with a 1-3 on 1d6. Their rubbery bodies are immune to damage from blunt
weapons.

Slug Drug

In one of the deeper caverns of the underworld the adventurers might be
unlucky enough to happen upon a convocation of 15 giant slugs of P’nahk
worshipping the slug-god, the spewer of ultimate wisdom. Psychotropic
slimes hang about the cavern, and the slaves of the slugs, miserable
looking hobgoblins (30 of them) with vacant stares and pasty skin, beat
drums in time to their wriggling. A deep well in the floor of the cavern
erupts in a miasma of slime that delivers strange visions (and possible
mutations to non-slugs) and, at the height of the ceremony, provides a
portal into P’nahk too small for the slugs to enter. The hobgoblins wear
ragged leather armor and are armed with axes and swords, and serve as the
first line of defense in case of an assault.

Move: 3
Alignment: Neutrality

Challenge Level/XP: 6/400
Gibbering mouthers are amorphous blobs of flesh with multiple eyes and
mouths appearing and disappearing from the quivering mass of the body
as it moves along. The mouths gibber and babble meaningless, speechlike noises; the monster is perpetually accompanied by this disturbing and
inhuman sound except when it is waiting to ambush prey, in which case
the eyes and mouths are all kept closed, and the monster appears to be
nothing more than an oozy pile of earth. When the mouther spots prey,
it begins gibbering loudly, causing anyone within 60ft to make a saving
throw or become confused (per the spell). Each round spent listening
to the mouther requires another saving throw. In any given round, the
mouther will have six mouths available either to spit or to bite. The
creature’s spittle flashes brightly upon impact with most surfaces, causing
anyone nearby to make a saving throw or be blinded for one round. The
mouther’s bites are not particularly deadly in and of themselves, but once
a mouth hits it fastens on and continues to do automatic damage thereafter.
Also, if a character has 3 or more mouths fastened to him, there is a risk of
slipping and being covered by the mouther (which allows the mouther to
attack with 12 additional mouths on its underside). The chance of slipping
is 5%, and if more than 3 mouths are attached the chance increases by 5%
per additional mouth. The ground around a gibbering mouther, in a radius
of 5ft, will be soft and mud-like, for the mouther changes the consistency
of the ground beneath itself.

Move 3; Save 13; AL N; CL/XP 6/400; Special: Gibbering, spit,

What’s in the Sphere?

Deep in a dungeon there is a chamber of red brick that holds a well. The
well is 7 feet in diameter, and though the first few feet of the well are clad
in the same red brick that fills the chamber, the remainder (it is 40 feet
deep) are natural, carved granite. Heat rises from the well, and it doesn’t
take infravision to tell that at the bottom of the well magma sputters and
pops. One can also tell that, just above the surface of the magma, there is
a tunnel opening.
The chamber of the well measures 20 feet wide and long, with the walls
slanting inward to meet at a point 40 feet overhead. From this point, a
10-foot-long chain hangs, a metallic sphere suspended from it. The
sphere is about 5 feet in diameter and has an obvious door (which, not
coincidentally, is on the proper side of the sphere to allow a person who
descended in it to exit on the same side as the tunnel in the well below).
A secret cache in one wall holds a winch that permits one to lower the
sphere. Those who do, and who open the sphere’s door, discover to their
chagrin that it is occupied by a gibbering mouther who is not happy to
see them.

Glass Butterflies are tiny, wizard-made entities, made of colored glass
and resembling butterflies the size of a bird or cat. They were once made
as decoration for the noble houses of antiquity, and are usually found
in large numbers flitting aimlessly about. Glass Butterflies will usually
ignore any creature that comes near them, and simply fly a few feet away
if attacked. They are constantly in motion, creating a pleasant play of light
and color if there is a light source present, and only touch the ground when
destroyed. Being mindless, they are unaffected by spells such as sleep,
charm, and hold. They are otherwise extremely susceptible to damage,
and can be easily destroyed. However, the magic that animates a Glass
Butterfly is too powerful to be contained in such a frail and simple vessel.
When slain, there is a burst of energy in a 2ft radius. This does not cause
damage, but has a cumulative chance of causing a random spell effect,
equal to 5% per Glass Butterfly destroyed in the past turn. Whenever the
percentage reaches 100%, it resets to 0%. If caught in an area effect, 1
Glass Butterfly is destroyed per dice of damage, and one damage die is
rolled to determine how many additional Glass Butterflies are destroyed.
Any Light spell cast upon a Glass Butterfly is increased by 50% in both
duration and area of effect.

The Color of Breaking Glass

A tall tower of coral blocks on the seaside is topped by an onion-shaped
dome of translucent agate. The tower has a secret entrance , and within is
a spiral stair leading up to the dome (and protected by a number of traps).
The dome is a wizard’s garden, one of the most impressive ever built.
The dome has a floor of limestone tiles. It is filled with pots, large and
small, containing a variety of herbs (especially wolfsbane and deadly
nightshade) and several wondrous plants, including several mandrake, a
barnacle tree allowed to hang over a basin of saltwater, a small bohun upas
(bonsai-style), an yggdrasil nut (it will hatch in just three more centuries),
a vegetable lamb, still small, but already softly bleating, fern flowers, a
patch of hungry grass (under a copper mesh), a vampiric pumpkin that has
seen better days, and a Charybdis fig growing up the walls of the dome.
The dome is protected by a vast swarm of glass butterflies. When
people enter, the butterflies flock to them, with dozens of the pretty things
covering each person who enters. Any violent movement taken by a
person so covered forces them to make a saving throw to avoid 1d6 of the
butterflies breaking and releasing their energies.

Glimmer of Death

While walking through a dismal, misty swamp, a party might come
across a corpse frozen against a swamp oak, a golden box clutched in
its arms. The box, if chipped out (or if one waits for the ice to melt – it
takes about 30 minutes), will be found to contain two platinum earrings
(worth 100 gp). The corpse was created by a band of 5 glimmers, which
are still in the area. Their lair, a small, half-submerged cave clad in ice,
is about 500 yards away. It was once a dragon’s lair, and embedded in
the ice is what remains of the dragon’s hoard: An elven lyre, a golden
brown fez (a bit oversized), three lapis lazuli-encrusted keys (large, stone
keys; worth 75 gp each), a blue-steel necklace (worth 15 gp), a dark, blueviolet scale (probably left by the former inhabitant), a +1 scythe (treast as

The Glitterskull is a gold-plated skull, with large red gems set into the
eye sockets. It flies by magical levitation, and is surrounded by a reddish
halo. This halo is of magical flame, and causes a roaring sound when the
creature is flying about. It also sheds light in a 15ft radius, and at a distance
may be mistaken for torchlight. The skull is that of a wizard, usually but
not always human. A glitterskull has the spellcasting ability of a level 8
magic-user, and does not require a spellbook to regain its daily spells.
Being a former wizard, the glitterskull prefers to attack by casting spells,
but it may also fly at opponents, ramming into them for 1d6 damage. Its
fiery halo does not cause extra damage, but may ignite flammable objects.
Glitterskulls can only be harmed by magical weapons. They can catch a
Magic Missile spell within their eyes, and hurl it back at the caster the
following round (instead of attacking) or use the spell energy to heal
themselves (spell damage adding to HP). Glitterskulls are also immune to
poison and gas attacks, and take only half damage from fire-based attacks.
The glitterskull is capable of speech, and retains much of the intelligence
of its former life. While it may parley with strong parties, the mind trapped
inside a glitterskull has been warped by the millennia, and most utter little
more than mocking laughter and scornful commentary. The gems and
gold plating of a glitterskull may be worth anywhere from 200 to 1,200
GP, in addition to other treasure.

Alas, Poor Yorvin

Beneath a ruined monastery hidden in the black hills there is a secret

protector of the crypt. Here, he awaits the arrival of a worthy successor to
whom he can reveal a staff of wizardry (hidden among the bones and made

of the Grey Scholars that dwell on the other side of the Green Mountains.

Intelligent frog-like humanoids, Glurm can usually be found sitting
in meditation or study amid scenes of natural beauty. They wear simple
loincloths and will have a bamboo staff within arm’s reach. Their
dwellings are of woven reeds, and contain only a few simple items. If
there are several glurm in the area, there will be a “place of harmony”
near a stream or river. This will be a cleared expanse of sand, dotted with
boulders to sit upon; the glurm come here to discuss philosophy and
practice their martial arts.
The spiritual studies of the glurm have given them mystical powers,
and they practice martial arts, accounting for their armor class. Glurm
are pacifists, and if threatened will attempt to drive off foes with an
intimidating display of martial arts. All onlookers within 30ft must make
a saving throw or back away for 1 round. If forced into combat, a glurm’s
unarmed strikes cause 1d4 damage; opponents of equal or smaller size
can only act after the glurm in the following round if the glurm inflicts
maximum damage. Armed with a bamboo staff, a glurm can focus its
spiritual energy for a +2 bonus to damage; in addition, if the attack roll
is 4 or more higher than required to hit, the glurm may disarm a foe, trip
them up, or perform a similar manuever. In an open area, the glurm may
also use its staff to make a pole-vault kick against an opponent up to 10ft
away, possibly knocking them down. Lastly, the glurm has the abilities of
a level 3 cleric.
Any treasure possessed by the glurm will generally be in the form of
scrolls discoursing on obscure philosophical topics, and finely crafted
writing materials.

The Glurm Lord’s Rest

In a tranquil clearing, one might find a stone statue of a glurm sitting
atop a giant tortoise set in the middle of a jade-green pond. Paper lanterns
hang from surrounding magnolia trees, and stone columns, carved with
prayers, protrude from the waters. This is the tomb of a great master of
the local glurm, who was actually caught while in meditation with his
mentor, the tortoise, and turned into stone by a medusa. The glurms
cannot release him from this curse, but reward anyone who can. They
allow nobody access to their master, though, until they prove themselves
worthy by challenging the ogre mage of the far Mountain of Cranes and
bringing back from his court a cup of mead brewed from the honey of his

war elephants by the gnolls. The gnolls also keep packs of hyenas (all
owned by the chief and kept by his female slaves), which roam the camp
at night, picking off the weak as well as runaway slaves and unwelcome
guests. Besides the 200 warriors of the tribe and their females and young,
the gnolls keep about 80 human slaves. The males are hobbled and used as
servants, while the females are made feral and slightly mad, and are used
to handle the hyenas and as hunting dogs in their own right. The gnoll
chieftain, Zzagor, dwells in an enormous tent (it takes three mastodons
to move it) with his sub-chiefs, harem and servants. He currently holds a
princess of the peri captive and in chains, and is entertaining a delegation
of elves who are begging for her release.

goblins feed when they cannot find meat. They also favor boiling captives

quite similar to flying squirrels. These membranes grant the belfry goblin the ability to glide, and in no way inhibit the ability of their hands to
manipulate objects. Hanging upside down on the ceiling in dark corners,
belfry goblins are all but invisible, waiting for their prey to pass by and
then attacking with a deadly swooping attack, a javelin in each hand, doing double damage on a successful hit with the swooping attack. If the
swoop attack succeeds on a “to hit” roll of 18 or better, the belfry goblin
does additional damage as it passes by, raking with its foot claws for an
additional 1d6 damage. A belfry goblin has 2 attacks per round, with any
combination of its hand held weapon, claws, or bite. The bite of a belfry
goblin is dangerous in much the same way as a rat bite, with a 5% chance
per bite the victim will contract a disease. Diseased victims will sicken
and die within 1d6 days, unless the victim rolls a saving throw.
For every 20 belfry goblins encountered there will be a leader with the
maximum of 9 hit points and who attacks as a 2 HD creature. If a nest
of 40 or more individuals is found, there will be a chieftain with 2+2
HD who attacks as a 3 HD monster. The chieftain will have an honor
guard of 4 particularly fearsome warriors whose stats are equal to that
of the leader type. There is also at least a 15% chance that in any belfry
goblin encounter there will be a vampiric variant present. The chance
to encounter these special vampiric belfry goblins increases to 30% for
standard lairs and 60% for nests of 40 or more.

It’s a Belfry, but Forget the Bats

The grand metropolis, beset by war, famine and plague (not to mention
death), now has many abandoned squares and plazas, where monsters
various and sundry hold sway. One square, the Court of Plasterers, had a
wonderful bell tower of white brick and porphyry ornaments. Constructed
by the Plasterer’s Guild in honor of Saint Bartholomew, the bell tower
is now occupied by a gang of 10 belfry goblins. The goblins have rusty
weapons, and have hidden a parcel filled with a clutch of petrified red
dragon eggs in the bell.

These creatures are physically weaker and lighter in coloration than
the standard belfry goblin, having only 1-1 HD, but they are able to gain
strength from drinking the blood of their victims. On a successful bite
attack, the vampiric belfry goblin sucks blood from its victim for 1d4
points of damage, wrapping its arms and legs around the victim and
holding them fast. Each subsequent round, the victim must break the grip
or the vampiric belfry goblin automatically drains an additional 1d4 hit
points of blood drain; the chance to break the grip is 30%. Vampiric belfry
goblins gain temporary bonus hit points from blood they drink, gaining
1 hp for every 1 hit point drained from a victim, up to double its normal
number of hit points. Once the vampiric belfry goblin exceeds its normal
hit points, it gains +1 to hit and damage.

Oh, Here’s the Bat!

Beneath the abandoned bell tower, behind a secret door and down a
narrow, spiral stair (one of the steps is rigged to collapse, sending people
rolling to the bottom of the stairs for 2d6 points of damage), there is a
small room. The room is barred by a locked, iron door. Within this room
one finds a collection of gears and a large, wooden counterweight banded
in iron. The counterweight is actually hollow, and serves as the coffin
for a vampiric belfry goblin, the master of the goblins who live in the
bell tower above. The coffin also holds a small ebony box containing 20
platinum pieces and three pinches of dust of appearance in folded wax
paper sealed with the mark of the famed magi Ambrosius of Gax.

Redcaps (or chaos goblins) are goblins driven mad by the insidious
effects of raw Chaos, reducing them to a bestial state. Utterly devoid of
empathy with any living creature, including ordinary goblins, redcaps
delight in inflicting pain. Indeed, redcaps derive a strange form of
sustenance from doing so. Any successful attack a redcap achieves heals
it for an amount equal to the amount of damage it deals to its target.
Worse yet, a redcap can double its total hit points in this manner. Thus,
a undamaged redcap with 5 hit points who manages to deal 3 points of
damage on its attack will now have 8 hit points and, assuming it continues
to remain undamaged, can be “healed” for another 2 hit points before
reaching its maximum potential hit points. Though thoroughly insane,
redcaps work well with others of their kind, forming predatory packs that
attack any creature they can find. Redcaps often take gruesome souvenirs
of their victims, such as fingers, ears, and eyeballs, which they use to
adorn themselves. Many also use the blood of their prey to dye their
tattered clothing, including their hats, the practice of which gave these
foul aberrations their common name.

Red Caps, Rotten Attitudes

An old stone castle of reddish stone overlooks a bleak region of moors
that crackle with ambient electrical energies left over from the creation
of the cosmos. The castle is occupied by a band of brothers: 7 redcap
goblins with red-rimmed eyes, caps soaked in blood, leather breeches and
iron-shod boots. Each redcap is armed with a long, iron spear, and they
always keep one goblin posted as a guard to look out for travelers on the
ancient Blue Road of Kalmakka. The goblins have the normal amount of
treasure, but half the value should be in the form of perfectly aged, smokyflavored whiskey.

Golems

Golems are man-shaped creatures built to serve their masters, usually powerful wizards or high priests. They are often used as guardians.
Golems cannot be hit with non-magical weapons, and are immune to the sorts of spells used to create them (iron golems being immune to fire,
for instance). You can find the details in the specific monster descriptions.

The “original” golem of folklore, clay golems may be created by
Clerics or powerful priests. They are massive clay statues of human
beings, imbued with a rudimentary intelligence and the ability to move
and follow their masters’ commands. For each round of combat, a clay
golem has a 1% chance (cumulative) to go berserk, leaving its master’s
control and attacking enemies and allies alike. Clay golems are not
damaged by slashing or piercing weapons. They are immune to all spells
other than those affecting earth, and these have very diminished effects –
with one exception. An earthquake spell may be used to utterly destroy a
clay golem.

The Keeper of the Keys

Those portions of the grand metropolis that are still populated are
ramshackle and rough. One large courtyard, ringed by three-story
townhouses, bears a crude-looking statue of fired clay – a clay golem.
The golem was left behind by the religious sect that once occupied these
buildings (they have since mostly been displaced by others), a sect of
rainbow serpent worshippers. The clay golem holds two keys, both of
iron. One is in a clenched fist, while the other is actually inside the golem.
When these keys are put together, they open a secret door in the cellar
of one of the buildings that ring the courtyard. Behind this door there
is an ancient temple dedicated to the Rainbow Serpent and home to a
prismatic dragon (treat as an ancient red dragon that can change its color
to blue, green, white or black once per round, gaining the abilities of such
a dragon when it does so). Besides a gilded idol of the Rainbow Serpent
(weighs 300 pounds, worth 600 gp) there is a golden box through which
one can commune with the Rainbow Serpent.

The Thinker

Across a bleak expanse of ancient snow there is a chain of obsidian
peaks. In a cave in these peaks, looking out over the snowy plain and a
frigid sea, there sits a flesh golem, hand on chin, contemplating its painful
existence. The cave is stocked with supplies in wooden crates and barrels
left by a band of Vikings, who also left a map to their treasure (about 60
miles south on a rocky islet) in the form of cave drawings that look like
warriors hunting whales and seals. The flesh golem is not immediately
hostile, but it does tend toward violence.

this desert in narrow channels, but nothing grows here, for the desert is
possessed of a weird aura (invisible to the eye, but visible as an aurora
with detect magic). This aura is quite deadly; travelers must save once per
day (at +5) or lose one level and age 1d10 years. Corpses are sometimes
found here, corpses that look as though they died while walking or after
they simply surrendered to the deadly desert and curled up to die. These
corpses are collected from the desert by glass golems that serve the lichlord. They are returned to their master, who animates them as wights.

The War Goddess Waits

Within a dank dungeon there is a perfectly engineered system of canals
filled with brackish water and blind eels. The canals all converge on a
grand canal that leads to a great cathedral of chaos. Three iron statues
of war goddesses stand over this canal, each brandishing a morningstar
and round shield. The last of these (they’re spaced about 30 feet apart)
is an iron golem, who has been commanded to protect the temple. One’s
way along this canal is barred by several iron poles that stick a couple
of feet above the water. If any of these are pulled or pushed, they act as
levers that open up a trapdoor in the floor of the canal, creating a water
slide that deposits them in a vast underground ocean plied by small pirate
galleys crewed by such underworld denizens as dark elves, gray dwarves,
troglodytes, goblins and orcs.

Honor Always the Sun and Moon

A grand, ruined step pyramid dominates a grassy, rocky plateau amid a
landscape of tree-choked valleys and towering, snow-capped mountains.
Set into the eastern face of the pyramid is a giant sculpture of a warrior,
sitting and clutching his knees, with a sun motif on his face and chest and
eagles for arms. The western face of the pyramid has a similar sculpture of
a warrior with moon motifs and jaguars for arms. The sun statue has a long,
shallow trough before him filled with ever-burning coals. The moon statue
has a similar reflecting pool in front of him. One who approaches these
statues must take care to throw a handful of gold coins (for the sun god)
or silver coins (for the moon god) into their respective sacrificial troughs
or the statues animate as stone golems and smash the blasphemers. They
also animate to protect the pyramid, the entrance being on the top of the
pyramid, beneath the sacrificial altar, which slides out of the way easily
when one person is lying atop it.

Waxworks

You enter a circular chamber 30 feet in diameter, the walls of which
contain 10 evenly spaced alcoves, with the entrance and exit passages
spaced along with them. The chamber slopes downward slightly toward
the middle – only by a couple feet, but enough to be noticeable. In each of
the alcoves is a wax statue of a famous “bad guy” (use villains from your
campaign, or use characters like Dracula, Frankenstein, etc.). Each alcove
is lit from below (a continuous light effect cast on the stone beneath their
feet).
As soon as characters enter the chamber, a wall of force springs up to
block the entrance and exit (silently, of course; lasts for 24 hours). As
adventurers examine the chamber, they notice two things. First, there is a
1-foot-diameter hole in the ceiling above the center of the room. Second,
the wax figures begin moving. They are 10 wax golems, and work toward
grappling adventurers and dragging them to the center of the room where
hot wax pours from the hole in the ceiling. Those struck by the wax
suffer 1d6 points of damage per round. Once per week, orcs loyal to a
necromancer in the dungeon come to the room and look for dead, waxcovered bodies.

The adventurers find themselves on a battlefield of greys and browns,
with drooping, dying trees, puddles of reddish-brown water and many,
many corpses that look to have been dead for at least a week. Three
haggard old women in long, mourning gowns (with veils) and baskets
are roaming the battlefield collecting bits and bobs from the corpses.
Each carries a sickle, and each is an annis hag in service to a powerful
necromancer. The hags will not disturb visitors (well, unless they’re
especially hungry or out of sorts, maybe a 1 in 12 chance). Besides the
hags, there are 12 gravebirds that look like rotting ravens perched on the
branches of the wilting trees. They pester the adventurers for gemstones,
which they adore, and might be convinced to use their speak with dead
ability to question corpses. The gravebirds avoid the hags, and if they
believe a party is especially weak and carrying treasure, they attack them
as well.

Great Lantern Worms are huge megadriles that grow 100ft or more
in length, exceeding ten feet in width. They are subterranean, chewing
tunnels in rock before swelling to fit the tunnel. Almost their entire length
is taken up by the empty stomach, with their organs on the exterior, covered
by a tough membrane of earthen hue. At the rear of the worm’s long gut is
a photophore, a light-emitting organ used as a lure for prey. Once the prey
has travelled halfway down the stomach, the worm’s mouth will close and
acid will be sprayed from various points along the gut wall, requiring a
saving throw each round to dodge. Should the entrapped prey try to cut
their way out, any weapon that succeeds in hitting the stomach wall has a
chance of dissolving. The chance for a non-magic weapon to dissolve is
1 in 8, and for a magic weapon the chance is 1 in 12. Each time a weapon
avoids being dissolved, +1 is added to the chance of dissolving upon the
next hit. For example, if a magic weapon hits and is not dissolved, the
chance of dissolving on the second hit is 2 in 12 rather than 1 in 12. If a
victim manages to stay alive long enough to return to the mouth, he can
attempt to force it open (1 in 6 chance to succeed, +1 per helper). Victims
are digested within hours.

Imagine a massive cavern, the ceiling studded with stalactites (and
quite a few piercers), the floor marked by a myriad puddles (one of them
containing a grey ooze) and three exits. One of the exits leads into a
tunnel smeared with patches of green slime (the slime covers only the
first 10 feet of the tunnel). From another one can be heard the incessant
drumming of goblin drums (actually it is water dripping onto an ancient
suit of platemail left to rust by an unlucky adventurer). The third cavern
looks promising. It is fairly straight and there is a light at the end of the
tunnel. Of course, this tunnel is a great lantern worm.

Number Encountered: 1d2

Green brains are plant-creatures grown by the Shrooms (and possibly
by other malevolent races with aptitudes for magically altering and
breeding plants). Green brains are relatively intelligent, and are generally
used to supervise and oversee the activities of mindless or semi-intelligent
creatures using their powers of mental communication. In general, the
supervised species will be plant-creatures of some kind, but it is possible
for a green brain to act somewhat less effectively as the overseer for
brutish humanoids or other non-plant creatures.
Green brains are able to project mental commands and communications
at a deep enough level that the brain’s demands are clear even to mindless
creatures such as oozes or monstrous plants. Indeed, the less intelligent
the recipient of the orders, the stronger the green brain’s hold over it.
In addition to telepathic communication, a green brain can use its mental
powers as a weapon when necessary. A green brain is able to continuously
project a cone of mental force 50ft long and widening to 30ft at the end,
which has the following effects: (1) any spells being cast are disrupted,
although they are not lost from the caster’s memory, (2) anyone failing
a saving throw within the cone becomes somewhat disoriented, making
attacks at a penalty of -2 (duration 1d3 rounds) and having a 1 in 6 chance
to drop any item held in the hands. The green brain may also narrow
its mental focus to project a beam of concentrated, damaging thought,
inflicting 2d6 points of damage to any single individual who fails a saving
throw.

chamber, which is oddly shaped, with multiple pillars of varying diameters

the chamber, a pit that will be filled with the rotting corpses of 21 elves,
the prescribed sacrifice to the Great Green Goddess. The elves are being
held elsewhere by the mushroom men.

Green Slime
Green slime isn’t technically a monster, just an extremely dangerous
hazard in underground tombs and other such places. Any metal or organic
substance it touches begins to turn to green slime (saving throw). It can
be killed with fire or extreme cold, and the transformation process can be
arrested by the use of a cure disease spell.

There’s a Catch

The wizard’s vault has two massive iron doors with no apparent means
of opening them. They are locked, of course, but there are no handles and
the lock is within the doors. The only way to open them is via a small
mechanical catch hidden behind a false portion of wall. The catch is at
the end of a two-foot-long burrow. One can see the catch at the end of this
burrow, but what they cannot see is the canister of green slime suspended
above the catch. When the catch is worked (this requires an open locks
check at –10%), the doors are unlocked and can be pushed open, but the
canister is also opened, dropping the green slime on the would-be robber’s
hand.

Grey ooze is almost identical in appearance to wet rock, but it is a

a character in metal armor, the armor must make an item saving throw.

reverse gravity effect. The ceiling above the pit is also an illusion hiding
a 10-foot-high shaft. At the top of this shaft is a single grey ooze waiting
for its next meal to be tossed up to it. There is also a secret door leading
into a tunnel (one walks into the tunnel on the ceiling and then falls to the
floor) that leads to a secret vault (see green slime above or invent one of
your own).

Toad Pickers

A 60-foot-diameter mound of dirt pushes up through the Sin Mire
Swamp like a wart, bursting out of the muck and mire. A wide-mouthed
cave delves deep into the dirt, descending 20 feet under the swampy
morass. Coral-colored frogs with bright pink eyes and tongues cover the
walls of the swampy cave, creating a rippling wave of color that undulates
down the passageway. Mixed among the smaller frogs are 6 slightly larger
frogs that draw the eye. Three of the amulets are amulets of protection
(as a scroll of protection), while the other three are cursed. When worn,
they cause one piece of equipment (the most valuable or beloved on the
activator) to turn into a full-grown grick. If the grick is destroyed, the item
collapses into pile of coral-colored sand that turns into a handful of small
iridescent frogs.

Growling shadows are spirit creatures that inhabit darkness and
shadow, usually underground but in some cases in dark forests as well.
Their presence will immediately be noticed, for they make growling
sounds that seem to come from several directions at one time. A growling
shadow materializes and vanishes from place to place when attacking,
selecting a single victim at a time. Each round, the shadow will appear in
front of a randomly determined opponent and attack, disappearing again
so swiftly that only the one character being attacked has the opportunity
to strike back. The shadow’s attack automatically deals one hit point of
damage without the need to make a to-hit roll; if it is not killed before
it has inflicted 10 hit points it will retreat, sated, back into the shadows
whence it came.

Angry Shadow

Travelers may one day find themselves crossing a mountain chain
through a thickly wooded limestone canyon. The canyon is stained with
reds and oranges, and features many small cave complexes inhabited by
families of ogres (1 in 6 chance per hour of encountering 1d4 of them
out fishing). The ogres fish in remarkably deep pools of water, pulling
out large, blind tentacle fish. The ogres never leave their caves at night,
and actually use great boulders to block the cave entrances, for they
know well that a growling shadow lurks in this canyon, hunting by night
(4 in 6 chance of an encounter). Travelers might, at some point, find a
black splotch on a wall that was the growling shadow in life. A sword of
adamantine has been plunged into this splotch. If removed, the growling
shadow is dispelled, and a passage in the wall opens into a wondrous
underworld.

A grue is a nasty, large thing with dark grey or green skin, rather like
a half-filled water balloon ten feet long, with a huge mouth. Inside its
leathery skin, the grue is mostly gelatinous. Grues cannot coexist with
light; if they are exposed to a light source, they instantly recede with the
darkness. In the dark, however, they are dangerous. If a grue hits with a
natural roll of 20 on its attack die, it swallows the victim whole; which will
satisfy the grue, and it will leave if it is permitted to do so (the swallowed
victim will suffocate in 2d4 rounds and then be digested). They are nonintelligent, and are immune to blunt and piercing weapons (e.g., clubs,
maces, arrows, spears). Swords, axes, and other cutting weapons inflict
normal damage. Grues can magically extinguish one normal light source
per round at a distance of 100ft.

The Sausage King

A grimy placard sits outside this small house on the roadside leading
into a ghost town located in the valley below. The sign bears the words
“The Sausage King” with an engraving of a smiling sausage link wearing
a small gold crown. The crown is a gold piece pressed into the shape of
the headgear. Beneath the name, different flavors of sausage are written in
chalk with a price for a pound of each. Inside the shop, however, potential
patrons are sure to lose their appetites. Gamy meat sits in bushel baskets,
surrounded by clouds of flies that buzz angrily around anyone trying
to swat them away. Piled links of sausage fill a tub sitting on the floor.
Worms, maggots and other insects crawl through the rancid meat. Rat
droppings cover the floor.
The shop owner’s head lies inside a mound of sausage links lying on the
floor. He was killed when he couldn’t satisfy the hunger of his “business
partner,” a deadly grue he trapped in the shop’s cellar. The grue looks like
a huge deflated sausage lying on the dirt floor at the bottom of the steep
stairs leading down from a trapdoor in a backroom behind the counter.
When the grue consumes a creature, it soon excretes the victim as a mound
of sausage-like links. The Sausage King turned this horrible byproduct
into a business the people in the village couldn’t get enough of. Even
when people started vanishing, they didn’t put two and two together. Only
when the farmer made a misstep and became a pile of sausage himself did
the village truly suffer. The grue leaves its cellar lair each night through a
hole in the side of the house and hunts the surrounding land. It returns to
the cellar by dawn. It ate the townsfolk fairly quickly, and now subsists
on forest animals. PCs coming into the shop are fresh meat for the hungry
grue.

Found in the darkest recesses of dungeons or in the deepest corners of
attics, grues are the essence of Chaos and Darkness given form by evil
and a ravenous appetite for living souls. Grues have no specific shape
or form, save for the ravening, slavering jaws that close around the
unsuspecting, or those who would venture into the darkness without a
torch or match in their inventory. Grues are chaotic spirits that exist in a
10ft x 10ft area of pure darkness. Any light source brought into that same
area forces the grue to flee to the nearest dark area. Any creature within
the area of darkness is subject to attack by the grue’s jaws. For all intents
and purposes, grues are invisible to anyone within the area of darkness,
but outside of the area, a grue looks like “living darkness.” Grues are only
affected by magical weapons or weapons that emit light of some kind,
including a torch (which would act like a club). They are resistant to all
spell attacks, save those that have some sort of light component (a light
spell, prismatic spray or even fireball). Grues can magically extinguish
one normal light source per round at a distance of 100ft. A grue’s attack
will replenish its hit points with any hit points “eaten” from its victims.
A grue cannot replenish beyond its starting hit points. Anyone killed by
a grue will vanish, including all of his equipment. In 1d4 days, he will

Inner Demons

On the first new moon of the year, the people of a curious mountain
walk into a wooded valley that hides a great idol of Chaos, the demon
of primordial darkness. The idol is a large chunk of black stone that
glistens and almost seems to pulse when one looks upon it for more than
a moment. It rests in a wide clearing and is surrounded by five smaller
black stones. The people of the village walk to this place and disrobe,
though it is quite cold. Three chosen villagers are put in voluminous black
robes that completely cover their heads and bodies. As the others walk
counterclockwise around the idols (at a distance of about 12 feet), the
chosen three walk clockwise around the idols at a distance of about 4 feet.
After the thirteenth pass, the outer walkers suddenly fall to the ground in
a bizarre ecstasy, moaning and writhing. Of the black-garbed three, one is
suddenly changed into a grue and moves quickly to devour the other two.
When this is completed, the grue slinks into the woods and eventually
finds its way into the local underworld.

An eerie green mist seeps through the trees at twilight, stealing up to the
houses of those who have failed to leave an offering to the faerie folk of
the woods. It is the gwurrum, monstrous servant of the faerie court, come
to pay a visit.
The gwurrum is composed of equal parts choking mist and thirst for
blood. It can force its way through the tiniest cracks in any barrier, crawl
uphill, and pour down chimneys and throats like cold water. The misty
body is roughly 10ft in diameter, and its trailing tendrils can reach up
to 10ft from its form. Any and all targets within range will be attacked,
though if free to choose, the faerie monster will focus upon children and
small animals: those whose loss will cause the greatest sorrow and misery
in the punished community. Dim-witted and malicious, it can be distracted
by offerings of whiskey, recitations of poetry extolling the virtues of the
faerie-folk, and the singing of an unbroken voice. Iron objects cause an
additional 1d6 points of damage to the gwurrum (the mere touch of iron
causes 1d6 points), but these items will turn to dust within 1 round after

magical singing abilities, such as a harpy or bard, can keep a gwurrum
at bay for 1 round per hit dice or level. A gwurrum is affected by

In the morning, when a gwurrum departs, dead leaves will be found

The sea hag is a giantess much like the annis, but living in the seas, or in
fetid, salt-water marshes. These hags are so hideous that the sight of their
faces causes weakness from fright and horror; if the victim fails a saving
throw, his strength ability score is reduced by one-half for 1d6 full turns.
The hag can also cast an evil eye upon those she chooses to slay; but only
three times per day. The range of this deadly gaze is 30ft, and the hag’s
eye need not be met in order for death to occur (saving throw). Like the
annis, sea hags feast with gusto upon human flesh.

The Sea Hag’s Secret

Beyond the treacherous reef, but in plain view from the mangrove
swamp, there is a windswept island that, under a full moon, gleams as
though it were covered by mother-of-pearl. Day and night, the winds
howl over this island, making the water choppy and carrying a strange,
acrid smell across the water to the swamps. One can also see, sunning
themselves on the island, a dozen women, possibly mermaids, with pallid
skin and silvery hair. These women are actually aquatic ghouls, and they
are the servants of the sea hag Radhna, who holds a map that shows
the secret paths through the swamp to the lost city of Ossgare beyond,
wherein dwells the hag queen Morganui and her infamous Silver Legion.

Bridging the Dead

The only pass through a treacherous mountain chain is, at one point,
cut in twain by a curious chasm. The chasm is about 300 feet wide, and
spanned by a bridge of ancient manufacture (possibly a specimen of dwarf
engineering, though the elves claim it as theirs). The bottom of the chasm
is cloaked in a bluish fog in which one can sometimes make out large,
bulbous masses moving silently and swiftly. A host of harpies (as many
as would make a good encounter) perches on the ledges above the bridge,
waiting for folk to cross it. They attack as soon as people are midway
across, attempting to knock people into the chasm below. The fog hides
a sluggish river that flows into the deep, and the shapes are strange boats
guided by undead spirits.

Hit Dice: 2
Armor Class: 7 [12]

Saving Throw: 16
Alignment: Neutrality
Number Encountered: 2d6
Challenge Level/XP: 3/60
Hawktoads are levitating amphibians with the body of a very large toad
but with long, clawed front legs and no back legs at all. The hind end
of a hawktoad is a foot-long tail, like that of a tadpole; the full length
of a hawktoad is three feet. These bizarre creatures move by lashing
through the air with their tadpole-like tails, and attack by swooping in at
opponents, scratching with their tiny claws and lashing out with their long
tongues. A hawktoad’s tongue does no damage, but if the attack succeeds
the tongue has whipped around the character’s neck. If this happens, the
hawktoad lands at the back of the victim’s neck; it holds tight with its tiny
claws and begins to strangle the opponent, using its muscular tongue as a
garrotte. When a hawktoad is attached in this way, the strangling character
will find it difficult to reach around and attack, of course.
Each round thereafter, the character must successfully roll a d20 under
his constitution score or fall unconscious; each round a cumulative +1 is
added to the d20 roll, making it harder and harder to avoid passing out.
Once the character passes out, the toad strangles him to death in three
rounds.

All Hail the Hawktoad!

The barbarians of the Golden Hills are an odd sort. They look as savage
as any barbarians you might meet, with unruly beards and mustaches
(usually red or reddish-brown), wild eyes of green or gold and golden
skin they only barely cover with animal skins. As savage as they look, the
barbarians are champions of Law and Good, who plunder the humanoid
tribes of the hills and mountains and then sell what they recover to
traders who roam the coast. The barbarians dwell in animal hide tents,
their warchief holding court in the largest of these tents. There, he sits
on a golden stool, flanked by two bodyguards who wear mail hauberks
and helms bedecked with bright feathers. To one side, he keeps three
hawktoads, the mascot of his tribe, in a spherical, wicker cage. These
hawktoads are used to judge the righteousness of those brought before
him. Prisoners and visitors are stripped naked and brought before the
chief, where they are made to kneel. The hawktoads are released on golden
chains, and if they fly around the person clockwise, it indicates they are
to be trusted; counterclockwise indicates the opposite (the hawktoads
don’t really know the person’s alignment, just toss a coin). If the person
attacks the hawktoads, they are set upon by the entire assembly. If the
hawktoads attack and blood is drawn, they are pulled away and the people
are welcomed into the tribe as blood brothers of the chief.

Head-Stealer
Hit Dice: 3+4
Armor Class: 8 [11]
Attack: 1 weapon (1d6) or strike (1d4)
Special: Immune to sleep and charm

Saving Throw: 14
Alignment: Chaos
Number Encountered: 1 or 1d4
Challenge Level/XP: 3/60
A head-stealer is the headless, undead body of someone who has been
decapitated, usually by execution or dungeon trap. The body is animated
with a vengeful spirit, and seeks to re-enter society by removing someone
else’s head and placing it atop its own neck. Although the head-stealer’s
body remains in a relatively preserved state, its stolen heads continue
to decay, and the head-stealer seeks to replace them on a regular basis.
Although the head-stealer can animate its substitute heads, the unnatural
grafting of dead flesh to undead flesh is highly imperfect. The head does
not attach by magic, so the head-stealer is required to use a measure such
as rope or nails to affix the new head. Moreover, the head stealer can only
imprecisely animate a stolen head, and while it can cause speech to issue
forth, the slurring and twitching will tend to raise suspicion. As with all
undead creatures, the head stealer is immune to mind-affecting spells and
vulnerable to holy water. The head stealer can be immediately destroyed
by attaching the head it formerly possessed in life, if the head still exists.
Any attack against the head stealer may dislodge the stolen head on a
natural roll of 19 or 20, causing the head-stealer to attack at -1 until it can
reattach the head or a replacement. If deprived of a head, it may try to rip
one from the torso of an attacker.

Head Games

The adventurers pass through a secret door and enter a long hallway.
The secret door is one way only, and before them is a 100-foot-long hall
with blood-caked walls. Midway down the hall there is an intersection,
and at the end of the hall is a sealed tomb. About 20 feet down the hall
there is a scythe trap, long since sprung and now rusted in place, the blade
red with rust and brown with dried blood. As one passes this trap, a headstealer appears at the end of the hall, looking like a headless man wearing
mirror armor (treat as plate mail) and wielding a pata (gauntlet sword).
This man was once Rugali, an anti-paladin of Yama, who lost his head
while seeking the tomb of Katimal, a paladin of Krishna (the tomb that
lies at the end of this hall). The head-stealer now haunts these passages,
defending the tomb from others (if he can’t despoil it, then nobody can)
and chasing people through the winding corridors of this section of the
dungeon until he or they have been destroyed. The only way out of this
section of the dungeon is through Katimal’s tomb (a sanctified place,
provided it is not robbed), where a complex dance (depicted on the walls
in bas-relief) can open a portal that allows people to pass to a hidden
cavern of delights.

A headless hound appears to be a large black dog, but with an eerie
green glow where the head should be. The creature’s flanks may be lined
with scars or torn open, exposing faintly glowing bones and the absence of
innards. The headless hound attacks with a ghostly bite that passes straight
through clothing and armor to the flesh. The defender’s armor class is
modified only by any Dexterity bonus. Bitten flesh heals at half normal
rate unless magic is used. If five or more headless hounds are present, their
howling requires a saving throw to avoid fleeing in fear (only required
once). The headless hound takes half damage from normal weapons.
Despite their spectral nature, headless hounds are not undead. However,
they are immune to sleep, charm, and hold spells. They are more properly
faerie-kin, and according to folklore will cease their haunting and join
the wild hunt if it passes nearby. Anyone slain by a headless hound has a
chance of returning from the grave as a shadow-like spirit, to be pursued
nightly by the headless hound pack.

Head for the Hills

In the hills surrounding the great inland sea, there are many quaint
villages, remnants of an elder empire that long ago fell into ruin, leaving
behind a multitude of peaceful halfling freeholds. An old imperial road of
bricks runs around the northern and western shores of the sea, connecting
the villages via a network of smaller dirt roads with the old imperial
capital, now a ruin save for a single guard tower, controlled by the halfling
sheriff Izbrand and his merry men, and a large courtyard which serves as
a marketplace for the surrounding villages. These market fairs are lively
affairs that are well attended. The fairs start early in the morning, but at
noon, the revelers and marketers and merchants all pack their goods and
head back into the hills. Izbrand and his men retire into their guard tower
(they’re willing to put people up in the dungeon for a price – think of it
as an odd bed and breakfast) and lock the doors securely. No guards are
posted outside at night.
This is because of another feature of the ruined capital where stands the
old church of St. Althea, halfing saint of home and hearth. The church has
long since been forsaken, and now sits in the middle of a great cemetery
of small, stone sarcophagi and a few larger crypts. At night, a headless
hound stalks not only the cemetery, but also makes forays into the ruined
streets and as far as the marketplace. It is controlled by the necromancer
Thrush, who occupies the church cellar along with a band of halfling
grave robbers and perhaps a zombie or two.

These creatures are demonic felines, often kept as pets by the denizens
of the netherworlds. In some cases, they may find their way to the material
planes, either by being summoned or by being sent there to serve as the
ally (or tempter) of a Chaotic villain who has made a pact with the powers
of darkness.
Hellcats cannot be seen in the light, and even in the darkness they are
little more than a feline shape limned in strange shadow, the size of a
leopard or other great cat. Like most cats of demonic persuasion or not,
hellcats can be fickle in their allegiance; a hellcat may change its preferred
“master,” attaching itself to a particularly Chaotic individual in preference
to its original one. Most hellcats encountered on the Material Planes are
female; the tomcats are rare, larger, and less capable of traveling from one

Hellcat Valley

In a steamy, godforsaken jungle there is a deep basin called the Demon
Land by the natives. The basin has sheer walls, 1d6 x 100 feet high, and
the floor is covered in a thick growth of primordial trees and choking
swamps. This basin is inhabited by dinosaurs and hunted by a large pride
of hellcats (3 in 6 chance per day of encountering 1d6 of the monsters).
The hellcats make their lairs in small caves, one to a customer. One
lair holds a tomb in which is imprisoned a demon princess, Sxamarya,
interred here along with her guard of hellcats (who went native) by Orcus
for failure to pay a secret debt.

with a bite that can swallow whole on a natural 20. It takes three rounds to
completely swallow a victim, but the victim will turn into a zombie within
1d4+1 rounds after being swallowed. Then the hieroglyphicroc will

Crocodile Fears

Along a slow-moving river one can see, in the distance along the left
bank, the ruins of an ancient temple constructed of red sandstone. A canal
diverts the river here toward the temple (and possibly beyond), and as
one approaches the entrance to the canal they see increasing numbers of
crocodiles along the banks sunning themselves, or dipping into the water
to investigate a boat.
The canal leads to the temple, which, it turns out, is constructed on
a manmade island of dark granite set in the middle of a pond ringed by
papyrus and blue lotus that grow along the margins, giving the entire pond
a heady fragrance. A dozen strange, white crocodiles sun themselves on
the granite island, and as adventurers enter the pool, they slide into the
water and make their way to the boats. If the adventurers speak the praises
of the god of the temple (perhaps Sebek, or another god or goddess that
fits better into your cosmology) and throw offerings of silver into the
water, the 12 hieroglyphicrocs escort them to the temple landing and into
the outer temple where they may pray and make further sacrifices. If the
adventurers make no offerings, the temple guardians attack them on the
water, or if they attempt to breach the inner secrets of the temple, they
attack them there.

The hippogriff is similar to a griffon, having the head, foreclaws, and

suggests that the hippogriff is the offspring of a griffon and a horse—but
they are apparently an independent breed, for folkloric tradition holds that
griffons frequently attack hippogriffs. Hippogriffs are not as hard to train
as griffons—again, from Orlando Furioso: “Drawn by enchantment from
his distant lair, The wizard thought but how to tame the foal; And, in a

their herds and all manner of terrestrial creatures. In one crevice, the
skeletal body of a magic-user is cradled in the branches of a gnarled pine.
In his robe (what remains of it), there is a golden whistle. When blown,
the whistle attracts 1d6 hippogriffs. Mind you – it does not grant the

In the Lair of the Hobgoblin Lord

Beneath the upper regions of a dungeon there is a great fortress of
hobgoblins. The fortress appears as a pair of thick, iron doors flanked by
bas-reliefs of gorgons that belch steam. The gate is unguarded, and opens
onto a stone bridge that spans a boiling moat (it does not run the perimeter
of the fortress – rather, it is a naturally heated subterranean river 50 feet
wide in a long cavern with a 40-foot-high ceiling). A 20-foot-wide span
of the bridge is composed of iron, and can be raised and lowered by 8
hobgoblins that guard the gatehouse beyond – a tall expanse of granite
marred only by a single, iron door (always locked) and eight arrow slits
located above it. Beyond this door lies the stronghold of the hobgoblin
king Wazzak, a series of tunnels and chambers cut from the earth. They
bear the typically Spartan decoration of the hobgoblins, and are full of
choke points, covered pits, and rooms with arrow slits and murder holes.
The chambers of the fortress include several feast halls, training
halls, armories, foundries, forges, smithies, pantries and butteries. The
hobgoblins brew a potent black beer and cultivate fungus for their bread.
They also raise plump giant rats, grubs and keep a coterie of 4 carnivorous
apes who have free roam of the place. Wazzak has a bodyguard of 10
rare hybrid hobgoblins with the paralyzing touch of a ghoul and the

Like Looking in a Tiny Mirror

Sigil runes carved deep into the mortar follow a flight of stairs that
descends steeply into a deep underground chamber that smells of burning
copper. Glyphs, spell notes and even full spells are engraved into the semisoft walls of the room (anyone copying one of the spells has a 20% chance
of making a mistake because of the crumbling letters). A copper vat sits
into the stone floor in one corner. The vat is three feet wide and three feet
deep. From its wide mouth flows a steady stream of frothy greenish fluid

of the person who bled, and swims for safety.

The Lady of the Meadow

On a high mountain plateau thick with green grass and yellow daffodils,
there is a large herd of fine, white horses owned by a nymph and tended
by a band of elves. The elves are crack archers, armed with longbow and
longswords, and wearing ring mail. They dwell in sod houses, and would
balk at their servitude were they not all deeply in love with the Lady of the
Meadow, and all pledged, as true knights, to her defense and succor. The
Lady dwells in a magnificent manse hidden in the mountains, but comes
down to the meadow at twilight on warm, summer evenings to pet her
horses and bathe in a cool pool on the meadow. The elves allow none to
approach the meadow at these times.

Hounds of Chronos, also known as Temporal Dogs, are canine creatures
from the Plane of Time (or a time-related other dimension). They possess
the innate ability to manipulate time in a limited manner. Temporal Dogs
hunt in packs that usually consist of 2 to 8 hounds. A Hound of Chronos
will always know where, temporally, the other members of his pack are.
Hounds of Chronos possess the ability to move forward in time. Twice
per day, a Hound of Chronos may “jump” forward in time. This allows
the hound to disappear from the present and reappear 1d4 rounds later.
The Hounds use this ability in conjunction with surprise to get the drop
on their prey. When they re-materialise 1 to 4 rounds into the future, their
prey has a chance of being surprised (60%).
Once per day, a Hound of Chronos may shift backward in time to when
it was healthier, returning “immediately” with full hit points.

The Hour of the Hound

Somewhere in the depths of a dungeon, the adventurers come across
the inner workings of a complex water clock. The mechanisms lie beneath
the laboratory of the archmage Raobin, who now dwells in seclusion on
the Plane of Time, elevated to that plane by its strange masters in part
because of his wondrous clock, which keeps immaculate time. Raobin
used it to track the heavens (which he could not observe, given his
seclusion underground), which are depicted above his laboratory on 12
golden dials, each 20 feet in diameter and cut with hundreds of small
holes, through which shines a permanent light effect from above when
important heavenly concordances are reached.
Within the inner workings, which connect to the laboratory above by
a secret (and trapped) door in the ceiling, a spherical polyhedroid (one of
the creatures that maintain the cosmic machinery) arrived the day before
to make adjustments to the clock and left behind a rather important key
to the cosmos. Should adventurers find and take this key (which is made
of adamantine, but otherwise quite plain, and was left hanging on a hook)
they begin to be tracked in 1d6 days by a pack of 7 hounds of chronos,
who mean to retrieve the key.

An abandoned cliff monastery dedicated to the goddess of thieves

Captain Clive (Fighter 7). They are lusty villains, but not bent on killing,
just robbery, and the gang just might be in need of a healer or magician

Her Maddening Song

A longship has run aground on a white beach studded with strange,
carved pillars. The boat has a gaping hole in one side, and will surely
sink when high tide arrives (in one hour + 1d20 minutes). One can see 30
men on the boat, large fellows with chests bare save for their long, mucky
beards. Many wear fanciful helmets bedecked by bronze boars and leather
horns, and one can see they are armed with shields and spears. Instead of
escaping their fate, though, the men just sit on the rowing benches, staring
straight ahead, gape-mouthed, at a siren perched on the bow of the boat.
The siren’s song has the men under a spell; she’s just waiting for high tide
to finish the job that she might pluck out their livers and any treasure that
is revealed at the next low tide. Saving the men is a heroic act, no doubt
deserving of thanks. Unfortunately, these men are berserkers, and once
freed from the spell, there is a very good chance they go on a berserk
killing spree. C’est la vie.

Finding Farka

Okay – a lair for a sergeant-at-arms. You’ll have to work with me on
this one …
When it comes to pass that the adventurers, visiting a town or city, are
in need of accessing something important — perhaps a comrade thrown
into a drunk tank or weapons that were locked up to keep them from
maiming the local populace — let it be known to them that the key is in
the possession of the town’s sergeant-at-arms, Breen Farka, a renowned
cad. Breen can be found at the Pickled Herring, a local inn known for
attracting “the wrong sort.”
Finding Farka is a trick. The inn has two common rooms — one serving
ale and platters of pickled herring and salted snails to a boisterous crowd
of rowdies, the other serving spiced wine and a selection of peppery
cheeses and crunchy black bread (heaps of goat butter) in pewter flagons
to a more refined crowd of lesser nobles, rakes with fabulous mustachios
and mysterious women in velvets and veils. On the second and third
floors of the inn there are large common rooms for the poverty ridden (i.e.
adventurers) and 20 private rooms per floor for the well-to-do. The fourth
floor holds a gambling parlor and brothel, as well as three large suites for
noble guests. Somewhere in this maze of rooms is Breen Farka.
Knocking on doors at night is dangerous work, for who knows what
one might find in a room (you might use a nighttime encounter chart for
settlements; maybe you’ll find a cantankerous magic-user trying to sleep
one off, a gang of cut-throats planning mischief, or a vampire dining
out). Farka is currently on the third floor, in the room reserved for the
tavern wenches, tying one on with the wife of Baron Blazengaff, who sits
upstairs blissfully unaware, playing trionfi and sipping brandy served by
women of modest mores. Farka has 3 guardsmen keeping watch, and
he’s quite adept at crawling out windows and finding secret doors. He has
several women he is intent on entertaining this night, so catching him in
the act will not be easy.

Well Protected

There is a fortress located on a river that flows through a wood that
stands as the borderland between civilization and chaos. The fortress is
built on a rocky plateau and has tall walls, seven towers, a great gatehouse
and a large keep with four towers. The fortress houses 60 men-at-arms
clad in blue tunics over chainmail armor, and mostly armed with spears
and light crossbows. The fortress also houses merchants, a cleric and two
acolytes (one an agent of Chaos), a jeweler and, at any given time, 1d4
adventurers. The fortress is commanded by a 9th-level fighter, who is
assisted by 6 sergeants.

Hydrae are great lizard-like or snake-like creatures with multiple heads.
Each head has one hit die of its own, and when an individual head takes
that much damage, that head dies. The body has as many hit dice as the
total of the heads, so it is a matter of good strategy for adventurers to
focus either on killing heads (when all the heads are dead the body dies)
or killing the creature by attacking the body (in which case the heads die,
too). Hydrae that breathe fire or regenerate their heads are also known to
exist.

A river flowing through a rooky wood widens at one point, becoming

silver-green leaves and coppery red apples hanging from the boughs rise

The apple trees are protected by a single hydra with twelve heads.

The thieves’ guild in Bargarsport has its headquarters in an ancient
underground manor once owned by a furrier who dabbled in the dark
arts. The place is grandiose and well-appointed, though each level looks
as though it hasn’t been occupied for many, many years. The place is
rife with secret doors and simple traps. The cellar hides a vault (made of
solid steel and protected by three traps – a lethal poison on a needle, an
explosive that fills the room with acidic fumes and a magical trap that
paralyzes a would-be thief until the curse is removed by a cleric or magicuser of at least 6th level). Before one can get to the vault, though, they
must make it by 6 hyenas, hungry and nearly feral. The hyenas respond
only the voice of the guildmaster.

Inaed are invisible, intangible spirits that inhabit books, scrolls and
any other object upon which words are written. They possess no ability
to attack directly; however, they can cast each of the following spells
twice daily: sleep, phantasmal force, and suggestion. Inaed inhabiting a
book or other object are entirely impervious to physical attacks, for an
attack directed at the Inaed only damages the “home.” If its host book is
completely destroyed, the Inaed will flee in search of a new book to haunt
- including spell books. Though they are not undead, Inaed may be cast
out of the books they haunt with a successful turning attempt. Treat Inaed
as though they were Ghouls for this purpose. Books that have been freed
of any Inaed, and books that have been blessed by a Cleric of 9th level or
higher, are immune to infestation. “Turned” or otherwise unbound Inaed
immediately seek out the nearest book to inhabit. Entering a book takes
2d4 turns, and it is during this time that Inaed are most vulnerable. The

of adolescent human females -- and can be physically damaged, although
only by magical weapons.

Love Letter

In the attic of the Manse of the Topaz Magistrate, a wizard of ill repute,
there is a small door (about 4 feet high and 2 feet wide) that is wizard
locked. Behind it, there is an oddly shaped hallway (a bit trapezoidal,
the floor slightly slanted to the right and down) that runs about 30 feet
and ends in a wall. There are no exits. At the end of the hall there hangs
a parchment scroll depicting, in a flowing, colorful style, a woman of
exquisite loveliness. There are words on the scroll in an unknown script
and language that, if translated with magic, read “Perfect Cycle.” The
meaning of these words is anyone’s guess. On the floor before the poster
there is a single chair, padded and upholstered in crushed red velvet, now
worn and dusty. The Topaz Magistrate used to come here to gaze on the
poster often, but his journeys have left the manse and the chair vacant
now for over eight years. His attraction to the place was predicated on
the occupant of the scroll, an inaed who was once his lady love Argentia,
a noble woman turned into an inaed by a jealous rival. She knows many
secrets of the Topaz Magistrate, and might divulge them to those who
promise to carry her scroll in search of her former lover.

a dark secret.
An inner child has strong psionic abilities. It can read minds at will (per

Inner Madness

On a run-down street crowded by buildings of a suspicious and vaguely
sinister nature, there is one building in particular that even the thugs and
rakes avoid. Once a hospice for the demoniacally touched (i.e. the insane),
the place was long ago abandoned by the clerics and their lay brethren,
all because of a man possessed of an inner child. The clerics were minor
in ability, and unprepared for the inner child, and so had to quit the place.
Several of the inmates were left behind to starve, and now haunt the place
as poltergeists. Two of the lay brethren were also left behind, and their
eventual hunger drove them into ghoul-hood. They are now the keepers
of the man with the inner child, who still resides in the hospice cellar,

bone, they witness an extraordinary event. A man walking through the
market, hunched, copper-skinned, with aquiline nose and red-rimmed,
crazy eyes, suddenly finds himself under attack by an unseen enemy – an
invisible stalker. The man is a 10th-level magic-user, but his unstable
mind has rendered him with only a few prepared spells, and his poor health
has left him with just a smattering of hit points. The invisible stalker has
been charged with killing the man, that his body and soul may be sucked
into the Void wherein dwell powers with which he made foolish bargains.
If saved, he introduces himself as Alhazred and reward his saviors with
tales of a Cave of Mystery wherein is hidden a very special tome of magic.

Monstrosities — igniguana to iounifier

Iounifier
Hit Dice: 3
Armor Class: 0 [19]
Attack: None - by projection only
Special: Improved saving throw, immune to electricity,
projection beam
Move: 0/25 (fly)
Saving Throw: 5
Alignment: Neutrality
Number Encountered: 1
Challenge Level/XP: varies – see below
The IOUNifier is a small, intricate tangle of wires and filaments with
infinitesimal motes of light dancing unpredictably within; they are no
more than one inch in diameter. Their small size, coupled with the fact
that they move very quickly, makes them difficult to hit with weapons.
An IOUNifier projects a beam of bluish light; if any person is caught
within the light, the shadow projected by the beam is a solid, material
shape that manifests within one round. Once a person is caught within
the light beam (requiring a successful to-hit roll by the IOUNifier), the
IOUNifier can hold the person in the beam without further effort unless a
wall or other very significant obstacle completely obstructs the beam. The
projected “shadow” of the target is shaped exactly like the person being
projected - it is constructed of wires that look like blood vessels running
through and around whirring clockwork internal organs, and with a facemask of bronze that resembles the face of the target in perfect detail. The
shadow wears armor and carries equipment identical to the target’s, but
these do not duplicate any magical effects of the originals. The shadow
has the same number of hit points as the living creature from which it is
projected, and regenerates 3hp per round until it is killed. It will attack
its original relentlessly until it is killed, whereupon it simply disappears.
If the victim is killed by its projection, the projection will instantly fall
upon the corpse, envelope it in its wires and filaments, and compress
itself and the corpse into an IOUN stone. The IOUN stone will respond
to the first person who picks it up, orbiting around that person’s head,
and granting a bonus to an attribute score for as long as it continues to
circle. The attribute affected depends upon the person who is compacted
into the stone; if that person was a cleric, the IOUN stone adds +1 to
wisdom; if the victim was a magic-user, the stone adds +1 to intelligence;
otherwise, the stone adds +1 to strength. These IOUN stones are not
permanent, lasting only 1d4+1 days; some other, lost, procedure seems to
be needed to make the stones last longer than this. The IOUNifier can only
maintain two projections at any given time, and cannot make a second
projection of the same person more than once per day. Note: attempts to
use IOUNifiers for personal gain, especially by nefarious means, are quite
dangerous - whatever programming drives the IOUNifier seems driven to
cause ironic and dangerous consequences to those who try to manipulate
them. The challenge level of an IOUNifier varies with its targets, and thus
can’t be calculated ahead of time. The XP value of an IOUNifier should
be approximately the same as a monster with the same hit dice as the party
has levels.

The top level, like the others, measures about 25 feet long on each side.
It contains several pieces of furniture, to whit a bed, two benches, several
bookshelves, a table, three wooden chairs and a more comfortable padded
chair, all of excellent workmanship. The bed is clad in silk sheets and a
woven covering depicting a gang of imps making sport of a nymph, the
chair clad in the hide of some reptile, and the bookshelves containing a
number of antique volumes (most in poor condition) of a sorcerous nature,
as well as several rolls of parchment (of an indeterminate manufacture)
containing gruesome paintings depicting the Toad God. The room is
decorated with a number of totem poles depicting not only Tsathogga, but
also smilodons, mammoths, leopard seals and primitive oxen.
This room is now occupied by an iounifier, which apparently was
drawn into the room when its former owner opened a rather crude portal
that deposited him elsewhere in the cosmos. The iounifier has dwelled
here for centuries, hoping beyond hope that the doorway to its own home
world would re-open. It is not inherently violent, and might attempt
communication with adventurers in the hopes that they can render aid.

Tower of the Frog God

In a bleak, northern land stands a five-sided tower, long abandoned.
The tower is composed of five levels, three above ground, and two below.
The lowest level holds a shrine to Tsathogga that has been thoroughly

Welcome Not Toy Man

While traveling roads on the outskirts of a well-known empire, one
might come across the Toy Man. The Toy Man, as he is called in these
parts, is a ragged peddler who guides a donkey-pulled cart filled with all
manner of toys – mostly rag dolls and toys carved from wood. The toys
are high quality, and the man appears to be quite pleasant, but he is quite
insistent when it comes to selling. If his pleas fall on deaf ears, he pulls a
sort of puzzle box out of his cart and presents it to the youngest member
of the party (he often mistakes halflings for children) as a gift, that his skill
might be remembered when next they desire to procure an amusement.
The puzzle box baffles the wisest of adventurers, and even a knock or
open spell does not open it. This is because it is a monster, a jack-in-thebox, who waits for its owner to settle down to a good night’s sleep before
creeping out to kill him or her. If tossed by the wayside, it follows the
adventurer until it has had the Toy Man’s revenge, and then tries to make
its way back to the old peddler.

The Minstrel’s Minions

An oasis of lush grass, multiple watering holes, and hundreds of date
palms serves as the lair and hunting ground of a pack of 8 to 12 golden
jackals. The monsters are quite bold, but they are also cunning. They
inadvertently guard a tent of blue canvas that was abandoned here by
a wandering minstrel laboring under a curse. The whereabouts of the
minstrel are anybody’s guess, but the tent now holds three days of iron
rations (one, in a wrapping of reddish-brown paper, has been poisoned),
a pot of oil (for polishing his bazuki), a 30-foot coil of rope, two velvet
slippers (worth about 15 gp) and a treasure map that supposedly leads to
some manner of black pyramid by a lost river about 10 days travel across
the desert.

These creatures resemble jackals with black fur, limned with a dark

them as guardians by ancient magics - the relation of the jackals to their
tomb-lairs is not known. They seem to be undead, in that they can be
turned (as mummies), but do not appear to rot, nor do they seem to be
incorporeal in any way. The black fire around the jackal acts almost like an
independent creature; when the jackal is in combat, the black fire streams
forth and can envelop one opponent (within 50ft of the jackal), causing 1
hit point of damage per round. The jackal can move the black fire where
it wishes.

The Unseen Pyramid

The golden dunes of a vast desert finally cease at the edge of a strange,
black river. The river is slow moving and has a mirror-like quality. Close
inspection reveals that it is a sort of winding canal of obsidian! The water
is warm, and might contain a hezrou or two if a Referee so desires. At
one point of the river, travelers come upon several obsidian statues by the
river’s edge. Each depicts a jackal-headed man (not necessarily Anubis),
the statues carved to represent people in the act of walking with their eyes
clamped shut. There are 10 statues in all, and they face the desert. More
astounding, though, is that their reflections in the river also show a giant
black pyramid! The characters can search the desert shore to their heart’s
content, but they will find no such pyramid – at least, not unless the proper
conditions are met.
The black pyramid does appear, but only when one stands facing the
river, waiting for the moon (from crescent to full, it does not matter) to
be directly above the pyramid. When this happens, a ripple goes through
the river and an obsidian causeway rises from the sand at the river’s edge,
stretching back to the pyramid. The viewer must not turn around just yet
– not until the causeway has risen under her feet. At that point, she may
turn around with her eyes closed, and take 10 steps toward the pyramid. At
the 10th step, the adventurer finds herself in a demiplane, concordant with
the material plane until the sun rises. Within this demiplane of reddish
sands and blindingly white sky stands the black pyramid, the tomb of a
mummified daemon and his court of 8 jackals-of-darkness. They need a
mortal’s blood to allow them to escape back into the material plane.

Ship of Wonders

One day each year in a great port, a golden dhow appears in the sky,
held aloft by a howling wind, its many pennons and its broad, white sails
in full array. The dhow passes over the city and lands about a mile away,
inland, with crowds rushing to the gates to follow it down. As it lands, a
gangplank is lowered and a cavalcade of strange sailors begins unloading
the mysterious ship – men with a single eye in their forehead, others with
no heads, but with faces on their bare chests, still others with purple or
green skin, or with only a single leg and arm. These men unload silk
pavilions and barrels and chests full of exotic goods.
The ship belongs to the janni merchant prince Khaliz, a wily trader
(and sometimes pirate) who scours the elemental and outer planes for rare
wonders to sell to noble and peasant alike. From nobles, he demands the
finest gems and pearls, the most delicious liquors and the most nubile
slave girls. From peasants, he demands tall tales, rowdy dances and oaths
of loyalty and friendship (and maybe a few copper or silver pieces to
make it legit). He is willing to take on passengers, but they must be sworn
members of his crew, and must serve with him for at least one moon
before he deposits them on some alien shore.

Abyssal Witch

Adventurers in a deep dungeon might enter a chilly room, about 30
feet long, 14 feet wide and 25 feet high. The walls are like slick, black
glass. Near the center of the room, there is a dais of snowflake obsidian
topped by a solid block of black stone (actually, it is solidified darkness,
and it will resist any attempts to pierce it). Within this darkness is the
sarcophagus of the witch-king Hazrepash Fish-Eye. The dais is ringed
by three lamps atop four-foot-tall iron poles. When all three are lit, they
descend into the ground, causing first a heavy one-foot-thick bronze door
to seal the exit, and second dispelling the block of darkness and revealing
the sarcophagus.
While the blackness is dispelling, a soft, persistent light also rises
behind the walls, floor and ceiling, revealing them to be transparent.
Behind them, there is a vast, still ocean inhabited by dozens of hypnotic
jellyfish. Though they cannot attack through the glass, they can hold
people spellbound. If the sarcophagus is opened without first placing
coins on the eyes of the bas-relief of Hazrepash, it sends the waters of
the surrounding sea rushing into the chamber to kill the would-be tomb
robbers. If opened properly, the sarcophagus contains three magic staves
of the Referee’s choosing.

Keepers Of The Well are semi-intelligent water spirits that enter the
material world at the behest of a powerful cleric. These spirits willingly
enter into a contract with the spiritual leader who brought them forth,
agreeing to be bound to a particular well or spring and defend it from all
creatures not part of the local village or temple. In return for its service, the
Keeper of the Well is freed from the slave-like existence it would normally
have on its home place or in the spirit world. A village’s Keeper of the
Well is often worshipped as a minor deity. A Keeper of the Well appears
as a large, snake-like column of water rising out of the opening of the
well that it defends. They cannot leave the well, though they can manifest
themselves from any opening tied to the local water system, instantly
appearing at the desired location. Keepers of the Well are immune to fire
and possess magic resistance of 75%. Spells that specifically affect water
(such as Part Water) can be used to damage or affect a Keeper of the Well
with results that may vary from the spell’s normal operation.

Village of the Drowned

Chalky symbols are written in the dirt on the main road leading into
the town of Ranoke. If followed, the symbols form a circle that surrounds
the entire village. Even standing outside the line, PCs see the bodies of
villagers lying motionless in the streets. A cleric named Bodoh sleeps in
a small lean-to in the woods north of town. Every day, the man walks the
perimeter of the chalk circle, redrawing the mystic symbols. He claims
a great evil in the town must be contained. He refuses to cross into the
village.
Anyone entering the town finds bodies inside the homes as well as those
in the streets. Many clutch at their throats as if they had died choking.
Their clothes are drenched and water fills their mouths and throats. The

villagers worshipped a keeper of the well that had access to the entire
town through a series of troughs. Water is evident throughout town.
Troughs fill automatically and wooden downspouts open and sprinkle
water across beds of blooming flowers. The keeper’s stone well has a
spinning wheel attached to the side that draws water up through a series of
moving buckets to fill the troughs.
An evil cleric angered by the villagers corrupted the peaceful entity,
dooming himself and the entire town. The tortured water deity drowned
the cleric first, and then turned on the villagers it had protected. The keeper
in the well can appear anywhere within town thanks to the ingenious
waterway. Destroying the troughs forces the elemental spirit back into the
well. It cannot leave the village because the water table doesn’t extend
that far. The cleric’s chalk symbols have no effect on it.

Khryll
Hit Dice: 8
Armor Class: 3 [16]
Attack: 8 tentacles (see below)
Special: Mental blast, liquefy internal organs, magic

Saving Throw: 8
Alignment: Chaos

Challenge Level/XP: 13/2,300
Khrylls are bizarre subterranean creatures, possessed of a malevolently
genius-level intellect. They have curving, jointed shells like that of a
crayfish or lobster, but without claws; rather than legs, the creature has
squid-like tentacles emerging from each segment of the armored body.
The tentacles of a Khryll permit some kind of limited levitation; a khryll
can float and maneuver in the air provided that at least two of its tentacles
are in contact with the ground or a wall. They cannot rise higher than the
length of the 10ft tentacles.
The origin of these creatures in the deep underworld is unknown, but they
are rapacious harvesters of most other intelligent species, even to the extent
of breeding slaves to serve as food. They communicate telepathically, and
their primary attack is to produce a mental shockwave that necessitates a
saving throw by anyone caught in the area of the cone-shaped psychic ripple.
The effect of the blast depends upon how many creatures are caught within:
1-2 creatures in area:  Natural 1 on saving throw = death,

Failed save = stunned 3d6 turns,

Successful save = panic for 1d10 rounds.
3-4 creatures in area:  Natural 1 on saving throw = stunned 3d6 turns,

Failed save = panic for 3d6 turns,

Successful save = confused for 1d10 rounds.
5+ creatures in area:   Natural 1 on saving throw = panicked for 3d6 turns,

Failed save = confused for 1d6 turns,

Successful save = confused for 1d6 rounds.
In melee combat (or at leisure if all its foes are incapacitated), Khryll
hold prey with their tentacles and insert a mouth-tube into the victim to
begin liquefying the internal organs. If an opponent is hit by any two of
the khryll’s tentacles, the khryll has an opportunity to jab its tube-like
tongue down the victim’s throat into the body cavity, and begin liquefying
organs for ingestion. This inflicts 1d6 points of damage in the first round,
2d6 points of damage in the second round, 3d6 points of damage in the
third round, and death in the fourth round (no saving throw). Once the two
tentacles have grabbed an opponent with successful hit, no further attacks
are necessary to continue holding the victim.
If the Khryll is hungry it will suck the liquefied organs through its
mouth-tube as food; otherwise it will lay eggs in the prepared body, and
these will hatch into khryll-spawn in 1d3+1 days.
Khryll society is quite complex and byzantine; in general no more than
six of them will be encountered together at one time, but in the deepest
caverns beneath the earth there are unquestionably much larger populations
of them. Their cities are said to be as much vertical as horizontal, with vast
schools of khryll floating up the sides of underground cliffs where they
have built bizarre structures and tunnels directly into the sides of their
great caverns.

Blubbery Flesh

A great albino sperm whale lies beached on the shore of an underground
ocean filling a massive cavern. The whale’s massive bulk is soft and
spongy with decay, and the creature as a whole seems to be deflating under
its own weight. A four-pronged hook juts from its mouth and a large iron
chain trails off across the rocky shore. The chain’s links are nearly four
feet long. The chain heads up the beach toward a dark cave. Around the
whale’s body lie the bodies of 8 hill giants. The hill giants’ bodies are also
soft and pliant. Pinkish goo dribbles from their slack jaws and ears.
A hill giant clan reeled in the whale lying on the beach. During their
celebration over landing the beast, they didn’t notice 2 khryll sliding
down the cliff. The khryll made short work of the giants, and then laid
eggs inside the whale. The khryll wait in the hill giants’ cave, their hunger
sated for the moment. Inside the dirty cave is the giants’ treasure: 14
pretty rocks, a golden rocking horse (200 gp), a side of rotted meat, and
a halfling skeleton wearing gray robes and a platinum crown (2,000 gp).

Servants of the Flute

An odd silver flute sits on a piece of folded velvet lying atop a crystalline
altar in the Forgotten Tomb of the Lich Abomination Ingrilurk. The flute
is warm to the touch and has numerous sharp angles and edges that draw
blood from those who try to play it. Engraved along its length are images
of galloping horses jumping from cloud to wispy cloud. Three 20-footlong chains wrap around the base of the crystal altar.
The three chains are animated objects that attack anyone approaching
the altar. Each chain ends in a wicked barbed hook that does 2d4 points
of damage with each hit. If a chain hits with a natural 20, it wraps tightly
around a victim and deals automatic damage each round thereafter
until the victim is freed. Touching the flute summons Erajellani, a
marilith demon tasked with stopping thieves intent on taking Ingrilurk’s
possession.
Playing the flute summons a ki-rin that serves the PC for one day. The
flute can be blown once per month in this fashion. Playing the instrument
does 1 point of damage to the player that cannot be healed.

Sher-myn Tank

A 10-foot-diameter giant snapping turtle stomps slowly through the
swampy marshgrass of the Sin Mire. Its giant head swings from side
to side as it slowly advances. The top of the creature’s shell has been
sanded down to a five-foot-diameter flat platform. A second flat ring is
sanded down around the central area, much like a bull’s-eye. Riding atop
the shell are 5 kobolds that sit behind a wooden fence driven into the
turtle’s shell around the rings. Each kobold is armed with a crossbow
and short sword. The kobolds can move quickly around the flat rings to
attack people on all sides of the giant turtle.
The kobolds can toss rope ladders down the sides of the turtle to
scramble down and attack. They are reluctant to do so until the turtle
softens up enemies. The kobolds keep their treasure in a locked box
bolted to the turtle’s shell. The box contains 114 gp, a silver harp (45
gp), a book about turtles, and a bag of mismatched earrings (15 gp).
The kobolds trained the turtle to carry them into battle. They named the
creature Sher-myn.

Ko’haai are large, 6-legged lizards covered in scales that coruscate
with varying hues of blue. They are normally found in tropical climates
where they are used as riding animals and beasts of burden by the local
populace. Ko’haai possess long, powerful tongues, used to make a whiplike attack. In addition to suffering damage, the victim of this attack may
have his arms pinioned if the tongue wraps around him (saving throw
at -2 penalty). The bite of a Ko’haai is mildly poisonous, inflicting 1d3
points of damage (saving throw at +2 negates), and the poison has a very
strange property with repeated exposures. The skin of any person who has
sustained 3 or more Ko’haai bites within a week takes on a discernible
bluish cast, which persists for 3d8 weeks. After six successful saving
throws made against Ko’haai poison, the body develops a permanent
immunity to the damaging effects of the poison, and begins to treat the
poison as a mild amphetamine, providing a +1 to attack rolls and saving
throws for 1d4+2 hours after being bitten (the downside to this, of course,
is the damage taken from the bite itself).

Round’Em Up

The village of Ank-Santal sits on the edge of the Seething Jungle. It
serves as a waypoint for those looking to mount expeditions into the
rainforest’s dark heart. Anyone who has made the trek recommends
stopping in the village first. The villagers know the secret trails through
the dense trees, and mounts and guides can be readily hired. Anyone
hiring one of the knowledgeable guides can easily shave days off their trip
through the forbidding jungle.
The villagers are friendly and helpful, but every one of them has skin
of varying shades of blue. The villagers maintain a stable of 20 ko’haai
just outside of town. They rent the giant lizards for 1 gp per day to those
heading into the jungle (as long as they take a village guide). A kapok tree
recently fell across the wooden pen. The lizard escaped into the jungle
but didn’t go far. Each night, the villagers place chunks of meat near the
rebuilt fence to lure the lizards back. So far, the lizards have eluded them.
They are offering a 10 gp reward to anyone who helps round up a lizard
and returns it to the pen. The lizards bite anyone manhandling them into
the repaired pen. The villagers have been bitten so many times that their
skin is permanently blue.

Catch of the Day

A hill giant sits astride a fallen oak tree sitting over a 30-foot-wide
gleaming sea inlet. The narrow finger of water pushes inland to form
a large saltwater pool. The giant holds a fishing pole and keeps a line
dropped into the water below. A second line is attached to a spike driven
into the tree. This line also disappears into the water below, where it
swings back and forth violently as something in the water struggles to get
away. Gold scales flash in the splashing water beneath the rope. Watery
voices scream, “Release us!”
The giant discovered that 20 koi folk swim into the pool each day to
spawn. The giant uses large redworms – irresistible bait to the koi folk –
to land the fish folk. The giant hooks each fish onto the bait line trailing
into the water beside him. He currently has 5 koi folk attached to the line
already. If freed, the koi folk reward their rescuers with a golden trident
(200 gp) they know rests at the bottom of the pool.

The Lost Villagers of Varnursal

The small fishing village of Vanursal sits on the shore of the Coral Strain
Sea. The 10 huts stand on five-foot-high pillars dug into the sandy beach.
Inside each hut, rooms are spacious and comfortable, with plush couches
and beds. Various decorations salvaged from the sea and surrounding
jungle give the huts an ocean getaway feel. Three huts contain large
wooden desks with numerous drawers. Wooden steps lead up to each
platform from the beaches. Fishing nets hang from railings around each
wooden platform. The huts are empty. Outside the huts, bloody paths in
the sand lead into the jungle.
The empty village is now home to 6 komodo dragons that crawled into
the huts in the middle of the night and bit the fishermen. The poisoned men
and women staggered from their huts and died on their beloved beach.
The lizards dragged the bodies into the jungle to devour. The lizards sleep
under the desks and beds inside the huts during the day. They snap at the
ankles of anyone walking into the rooms.

Kraken are gigantic squid-like monsters of malign, genius-level
intelligence, residing in the black depths of the oceans. When kraken
strike with their tentacles, they may wrap their prey and constrict
them each round for an automatic 2d6 damage, also making the victim
defenseless against the kraken’s bite. Ships may be constricted in the same
way, typically requiring 18 tentacle-rounds to crush the vessel sufficiently
to pull below to the kraken’s expansive undersea lair. Tentacles may be
targeted individually and severed. They each have AC 6[13] and 16 hit
points, which are not considered part of the kraken’s hit point total. Kraken
retreat by jetting backwards, at which point they may release a poisonous
80ft x 80ft x 120ft ink cloud. For a total of four rounds, anyone within the
cloud will suffer 1d4 points of damage. It is rumored that kraken possess
unnatural powers to control weather and to create false lights in order to

Water Colors

Strange colored lights flash across the waves as the sailing ship Imago
plies the waves. A storm dances across the growing waves. The smell of
salt hangs heavy in the air as the wind pushes waves across the ship’s
deck. The sails ripple and fill under the ever-changing elemental assault.
Sailors hold holy symbols toward the sky to ward off evil. The balls of
light dance and spin across the waters, a trail of colorful spheres that seem
to turn and move toward the Imago.
A kraken hunts the deeps of the Barrows Abyssal, an undersea cliff
dropping into the depths of the Reaping Sea. The beast rises under ships

under the rolling waves draws multi-colored balls of lightning down atop
the waves.

Crocodile Rock

A 15-foot-tall stone carved with leering faces stands on the edge of the

the river are 10 crocodiles, their heads barely visible above the waterline.
Capirona trees grow wild around the still pool. Monkeys dance in the
branches.
At night, a dozen ghostly spirits rise from the rock and dance across the
surface of the pool. A kurok-spirit that lives under the water killed the
beings, but the rock snatched their souls away before the ghost crocodile
could devour them. The ghosts’ nightly dance taunts the spirit crocodile,
drawing it to the water’s surface.
The ghosts lead the angry spirit toward living beings. The spirits are
trapped in the rock totem until they find a new soul to replace their own.
The stone absorbs the souls of those slain by the kurok-spirit. Each new
spirit absorbed releases one of the old ones. Killing the kurok-spirit frees
all of the spirits trapped in the rock.

This weird but benevolent race exists outside of the normal concept of time.
They may come from the distant future, but could just as easily hail from the
distant past or from an alternate reality altogether. When encountered, they are
generally working to defy the plans of their arch-enemies, the Tsalakians (another
trans-dimensional race of beings), and to organize resistance against them. The
Kzaddich (singular and plural) always appear as man-sized figures, completely
covered by cowled cloaks. Their own speech sounds not unlike wind chimes.
When dealing with sentient creatures, they use their native telepathy. Their true
form defies immediate description; uncloaked, they appear as an amalgamation
of shifting, softly glowing spheres in a rough approximation of a bipedal form.
The Kzaddich can slip in and out of the time-stream at will, and as a result they
are exceedingly difficult to harm. They can anticipate the future actions of their
opponents, resulting in their almost unhittable armor class. Moreover, they make
saving throws as an 8HD creature and take half or no damage from damagecausing spells that allow saving throws, and are allowed a saving throw against
spells that normally do not allow one - whether these spells cause damage or
not. They are immune to all person-affecting spells (hold person, charm person,
etc.) and cannot be affected by spells that affect time, such as slow or time stop.
Indeed, Kzaddich can ignore the effects of these spells and even interrupt and
share any beneficial effects of such magics. Kzaddich are loathe to engage in
combat, but if forced, they have the innate spell-like ability to haste themselves
at will. If faced with certain capture or death, a Kzaddich can, at will, simply
slip into the far future or past to avoid the situation. Kzaddich have considerable
mental powers. They can mentally alter the density of their bodies from a weight
of 0 to 500 pounds at will, heal all damage they have suffered five times per day,
levitate at will, communicate telepathically within 100ft with any creature, and
read psychic impressions left upon objects. The Kzaddich do not perceive time
the way others do; they can perceive the outlines of the future (90% chance to
make the most favorable choice between two actions). Kzaddich can never be
taken by surprise. Twice per day, a Kzaddich have the ability to create a time
stop (as per the spell, with a duration of 2 combat rounds). A Kzaddich can share
the time stop with another creature with which it is in physical contact. Almost
nothing is known of the Kzaddich culture; they vie against the machinations of
the Tsalakians on a scale that mortal creatures cannot comprehend, in a vast war
that spans time and dimensions.

Playing with Time

A bronze sundial stands in the middle of an open plain. The sundial’s
slanted gnomon is an engraved whale’s spine that rises 20 feet above a
flat stone disc marked with the hours of the day. Molten brass poured into
carvings in the stone set off the hourly markers. Anyone approaching the
sundial hears a voice in their head whisper a specific time of day. A cloaked
figure appears to anyone standing on the stone at the appointed hour. If the PC
fails a saving throw, he is whisked backward in time to the age of dinosaurs
to face 3 hungry Tyrannosaurus rexes. PCs can voluntarily fail the save.

A kzaddich is trapped in the sundial’s gnomon, but can communicate
freely with PCs who travel backward and forward in time to speak with him.
If the dinosaurs are defeated, the kzaddich from the past tells PCs a specific
position to stand on the gnomon to facilitate his release. The PCs return to
the present soon after. If they follow the kzaddich’s instructions, they are
swept forward to a desolate landscape where 6 Melgara accompanied by
2 Tsalakians wait for the sun to explode and consume them. The melgara
and tsalakians attack anyone who appears, thinking they have been sent to
stop them. If they are defeated, the kzaddich from the past reappears, this
time a much older and wiser being. He tells PCs that his present self can be
released by casting raise dead on the whale spine. If PCs do so, the spine
cracks and releases the imprisoned kzaddich. The odd humanoid gives PCs
a golden band that allows them to travel one day into the past or future by
destroying one of the 6 gems. Each gem is worth 200 gp.

Isle of the Lizard Witch

The Chum Swiller, a three-masted sailing ship lost at sea three weeks
ago, lies broken on sharp rocks surrounding Murgato Isle. The hull is split,
and the ship’s remains rise and fall into the jagged stones holding it in
place. One of the mighty masts is broken and lies across the deck. The
ship’s bedraggled white sail floats like a shroud on the ocean. Jetsom from
the ship bobs in the waves. No bodies can be found on or in the ship,
however, and its rowboats are missing.
The Chum Swiller’s sailors made it ashore, but that’s when their
troubles started. A squat stone tower on a cliff overlooks the white-sand
beach where the empty rowboats sit. A figure atop the tower waves a white
banner vigorously to attract attention.
The island is home to Varanus Karn, a lamia witch with the body
of a komodo dragon. Varanus is served by 12 lizardmen. A lizardman
atop the tower waves the white banner to alert his fellow lizardmen that
someone has landed on the beach. The lizardmen hunt in the thick jungle
leading up to the tower, but drop what they are doing to capture intruders.
Varanus resides in a comfortable bedchamber within the tower. Wooden
spikes around the tower’s base hold the dismembered bodies of the Chum
Swillers’ sailors.

capable of taking the offensive against threats to its wards – but because
they are often pledged to guard particular places, people, or objects, they
will often engage other servants of Law to pursue such threats. This

The Old Man on the Mountain

Local legend tells of an ancient hermit that, after he discovered all there
was to know, decided such depth of knowledge was not meant for others.
He left the local village, alone, and ascended the mountain, where only the
most dedicated of knowledge seekers would dare to follow.
Occasionally, a traveler seeks out the Old Man, and they to ascend the
mountain. These travelers are rarely seen again in the village; it is assumed
they either die on the journey or find enlightenment from the Old Man.
The truth of the matter is that the “Old Man” is actually a lammasu (the
story was pretty vague) that makes its home on a high perch of stone, many
miles up the mountain. The few travelers that make it past the stone giant,
the giant eagles, and the natural obstacles (landslides, deep crevasses,
tangleweeds, etc.) are allowed to ask the lammasu one question. If they
desire further knowledge, they are required to climb to the bottom of the
mountain and begin the journey again.

mouth. Once the monster scores a hit, it fastens to the victim and drains
blood automatically each round thereafter until the victim is dead. Normal
lampreys aren’t really dangerous enough to merit a separate entry.

Lost at Sea

A haggard mule swims in the open ocean as chunks of splintered wood
float around it. The bodies of numerous sailors float atop the waves,
pushed along by the currents. A few of the men are torn apart, their
entrails spilling into the saltwater. Bloody clouds float like dark spots on
the ocean. The wild-eyed mule fights to stay afloat. It has a saddle laden
with overflowing pouches strapped across its back. The saddle weighs the
animal down, but it manages to keep its head just above the surface. Rips
in a couple of the pouches allow jewels to spill out into the ocean and
sink from sight. The bags contain treasures a sailor tried to save before
the ship sank beneath him. The mule made it off the doomed vessel; the
sailor wasn’t so lucky.
The mule survived, but it found itself thrown into a new fire, so to
speak. A school of 6 giant lampreys are attacking the mule from below.
The bloodsuckers attach themselves to the plump pack animal and are
quickly draining its blood. The lampreys break free to feast on PCs who
jump in to save the doomed mule (or at least the jewels).

Lightning lampreys are floating creatures about three feet long that feed
upon powerful electrical currents and lightning. Schools of them drift
along in the wake of storm clouds. They are not normally encountered
away from electrical storms (some may sniff their way down from higher
altitudes if lightning is actually striking the ground). However, they might
be found in unusual magical environments where electrical discharges or
lightning is plentiful. Their bite inflicts one point of damage from the
sharp teeth, but also delivers an electrical shock of 1d6hp. Their bodies
are extremely good electrical conductors.

All Charged Up

Electricity arcs dangerously through this abandoned laboratory. The
bolts of lightning dance at the ends of broken chains dangling from alien
machinery. A flat metal table sitting in the middle of the room has links of
electrified chains rising from its four corners to the ceiling. A behemoth of
a man stands naked amid the arcing energy, basking in the sparking bolts
hitting his flesh. Scars cover the man’s torso, limbs and face. Metal rods
stick out of the man’s bare back. They spark and glow like bright embers
as each bolt hits the figure. The rods cast a reddish glow throughout the
room.
The man is flesh golem that raises and lowers the table via a pulley
system in the corner of the room. It is programmed to lift the table to the
roof three times each day. The golem defends the lab from intruders. The
arcing electrical currents are actually 12 lightning lampreys that entered
the lab when the golem last lowered the table. Anyone touching the table
or the chains takes 3d6 points of electrical damage (save for half).

A Leaping Maw is a weird form of parasite that has extra-dimensional
properties. It is never encountered alone, as it requires a host of some
form. A small creature can support only one Leaping Maw, but a medium-sized creature (such as a human) can support up to four, and a large
creature can support nine or more. The Leaping Maw looks like a small,
fanged mouth, rather wolf-like, sprouting from a host creature’s body. The
body is a fist-sized lump, hidden within the host’s body, and the host must
usually be slain in order to get to it. The Leaping Maw is able to teleport
itself directly onto any flesh within 30ft, and if it scores three successful
hits it has burrowed into the victim’s flesh. It cannot attack anyone who
is employing a protection from evil spell. Use of a dimension door within
10ft of a leaping maw kills one leaping maw per 3 levels of the caster.
Teleport will drive them out from the host. If a leaping maw remains in
a host for a week, the host begins to experience surreal and vivid dreams
and hallucinations that cause a permanent loss of 1 Wisdom point per
leaping maw per month. When the victim reaches wisdom of 0, he becomes completely controlled by the parasites, a puppet for breeding and
transmission.

Words of Wisdom

An elderly cleric dressed in gold robes raises his hands to the sky as he
prays to the gods to deliver the land from evil. The man’s hands are bone
thin, and his face is gaunt, as if he prefers talking to eating. Bowing their
heads to the dirty street around him are 10 acolytes. Each one touches his
forehead to the earth as their leader rambles on. The people of Crow’s
Maw stare at the long-winded cleric and his followers, then shake their
heads and move on. The cleric doesn’t notice the disdain of the magicworshipping populace. He keeps praying to the gods in a voice that grows
louder and stronger with every passing minute.
At the height of his speech, screams erupt among the people passing by.
The cleric and his followers are hosts for 24 leaping maws. The parasites
jump from person to person in the crowd, looking for an appropriate
host. The cleric and his followers are completely under the control of the
leaping maws infecting their bodies. The group travels from city to city,
infecting more people every time they stop to espouse their god’s wisdom.

Night of the Hunter

An old circus wagon sits on the side of the road leading into the small
village of Lehane. The colorful wagon is filled with moldy hay. The wagon
is clawed and scratched, and the driver’s seat is coated in dark stains that
might be old blood. A cagy leopard tore its way out of the wagon as the
circus was leaving the village. The great cat escaped when a “trained”
mammoth broke free as it was being led down the dirt road and punched
a hole in the wagon. The cat attacked the driver as it escaped its confines,
and then fled into the nearby woods.
Lehane is a virtual ghost town now. The wily hunting cat killed or drove
out the majority of villagers. The few who stayed fear the great cat that
still hunts within their village, but they have no place to go. The leopard
sleeps in a rooftop garden where it killed a dwarf tending his roses. The
cat climbs across the rooftops at night, hunting anyone unwise enough to
be out after dark. The cat is a quiet hunter that stalks prey from above.
It leaps down on PCs, clawing and biting, then flees into the village. It
repeatedly ambushes people wandering the streets of its territory. During
the day, it sleeps in a bower of roses where it hid the body of the dwarf
gardener.

The Lephane is a semi-aquatic relative of the Elephant, adapted for
dwelling in rivers and lakes. The main body, resembling a boulder, is
a shrivelled and shrunken mass, although it is still almost the size of
a normal elephant’s. The head is barely recognizable as an elephant’s,
as the ears are atrophied lumps; the trunk is much longer than that of a
normal elephant. The lephane attacks by grabbing and constricting with
its long, muscular trunk from underwater. Once it has struck, it can apply
continuous damage per round and can drag victims underwater. If the
lephane manages to drag its prey all the way to its mouth, it can also bite
for 1d6 damage. In general, any creature attacking it while it is in the
water will suffer a -2 penalty to hit and damage (except with spears or
other good underwater weapons). Breaking free from the lephane’s trunk
can be managed on a roll of 1-2 on a d6.
The lephane is an accomplished swimmer, but lazy. It prefers to walk
along a river bottom, poking the tip of its trunk above the water to breathe.
Like its land-bound kin, it has ivory tusks that will fetch a fine reward:
100-400gp per tusk. Unlike its land-bound kin, the lephane is omnivorous;
it can survive on roots and leaves, but it prefers fresh meat.

The River Wild

A wet monkey sits atop an overturned canoe in the Quall River. The
monkey holds a large gem in its hands. It thumps the jewel on the canoe’s
overturned hull, and spins it round and round in its hands. It smiles widely
at its reflection in the facets. Occasionally, it leaps up and down, causing
the floating canoe to bounce in the water. The canoe sits absolutely still in
the water, despite the current pushing past it.
A lephane walking underwater overturned the canoe, dumping an
elderly wizard and his pet monkey and their guide into the deadly river.
The wizard was no match for the currents and was washed downstream
to his death. The struggling guide died in the lephane’s crushing grip. The
monkey was able to scramble aboard the overturned canoe. The lephane’s
trunk currently rises just above the water inside the overturned canoe,
anchoring it in place. The gem was in the pouch he was riding in when the
lephane attacked. The monkey’s name is Mizo. It is written on a red collar
around the primate’s neck. Mizo befriends anyone who pulls him out of
the river and feeds him. The gem is a large ruby worth 1,500 gp.

Flickering Shades

The town of Griffon is empty, although every door stands wide open.
PCs that make saving throws see strange flickering shapes just out of the
corners of their eyes. These humanoid shapes appear and vanish near all
of the town’s doorways.
A grumpy leprechaun named Jaffers Kemp got even with the people
of Griffon after the highly intelligent residents tricked him one too many
times. Kemp discovered a magical clover (placed by a demon with his
own bone to pick with the town) that he used to curse the villagers. The
town’s doors now tap into the leprechaun’s dimension door ability and
trap anyone using them. Anyone stepping through a portal anywhere
in town must make a saving throw or be caught in a magical loop as
they flicker from doorway to doorway. The people appear as flickering
shades as they progress through the never-ending loop. PCs caught in the
loop can make a saving throw each round to exit a doorway somewhere
randomly in town.
Kemp dances merrily around the well in the town square. He is fully
enjoying the peace and quiet now that the townsfolk are gone. The
downside is that that the magical doors prevent him from using his own
dimension door ability. If he needs to flee, the leprechaun enters a random
door and can choose where and when he exits. He doesn’t leave the town
for fear of being caught without a means to escape.

Ash trees along the southern edge of the Dry Stalk Forest are dying.
Large bites have been taken out their trunks. The bark appears to have
been chewed repeatedly by large teeth. Balls of cud filled with splinters
lie on the ground around the trees’ roots. Some of the trees are nearly
chopped in half from bites ringing the bark. Halves of dead squirrels lie
on the ground. Even the rocks sticking out of the ground have visible bite
marks along their edges.
The damage is being done by a leucrota cursed to eat constantly or die.
The creature chomps on everything it encounters, be it animal, mineral
or plant. The leucrota moves through the forest, its flanks withered and
wasting away. It hungrily attacks anyone it encounters. The creature
doesn’t stop eating until it is killed. Even then, its mouth continues to bite.

Souls for the Forge

Molten metal and burning forges combine to produce incredible
heat and oppressive palls of thick black smoke in the Forge-Temple of
Kolamax. Silver streams flow slowly down channels cut through stone
gears that turn randomly to redirect the molten streams into various vats. A
waterfall of molten metal rains down from an upper balcony in the center
of the table. A circular table with metal clamps spins through the waterfall,
sending splashes of superheated silver flying. Smoldering bodies seared
black are clamped into place on the rotating disc. A withered body lies on
a stone table far away from the metal and fire.
The lich Arus Kezanlizil rules the Forge-Temple, claiming it after
an unforeseen accident transferred his undead spirit into the body of
the dwarven cleric Arbor Oakenchisel. The dwarf’s mind was rapidly
consumed by the lich, but his memories and abilities remained for the lich
to misuse. Kezanlizil believes that he can craft a blade from the spirits of
the dead that will separate him from the hated dwarf body he finds himself
trapped within. Kezanlizil has full access to his spells and abilities in this
new form. The lich has experimented on dozens of hapless victims, but
thinks he now how the means to craft the blade. He just needs new bodies
to fasten to the wheel to power his next experiment.

Lichenthropes are human (or similar) creatures that have been infected
by a carefully prepared mixture of spores and alchemical ingredients. This
infusion causes a condition with effects similar enough to lycanthropy
that the infected victims are treated as were-creatures for all purposes
except one. Because lichenthropy is an alchemical condition rather than
a supernatural one, lichenthropes are not immune to normal weapons,
as true were-creatures are. They are, on the other hand, still affected by
magic weapons that are especially enchanted against were-creatures.
At will, a lichenthrope can take one of two non-human forms in addition
to its human one. The first of these is a noisome agglomeration of fungusmaterial shaped somewhat like a dog. In this form, the lichenthrope is
resistant to magic (25%) and immune to any sort of mental control that
would not ordinarily affect a plant. The second non-human form of a
lichenthrope is a formless mass of fungus with an air bladder that allows it
to fly, provided that it has a full combat round to inhale air.
Lichenthropes can commune with any form of intelligent plant,
although they do not exert actual control over such plants.
Any character suffering 50% damage from the attacks of a lichenthrope
will begin transforming into a lichenthrope. However, since the process
of lichenthropy is alchemical and normally induced directly by a creator
of lichenthropes, the transformation does not always proceed in a
predictable way. There is a 50% chance that an infected character will
simply turn progressively into a mess of disgusting fungus over the course
of 1d4 weeks. During this time, whether the transformation is proceeding
normally or not, the process can be arrested and cured by the use of a cure
disease spell.

Beware the Moors

The Feisty Harlot Tavern & Inn sits on the edge of the Felderine
Moors. The tavern is run by a stooped old woman named Madame Ilista
Farnsworth. She wears a dark shawl over her gray hair, and a long dress
that hides her turnip-shaped body. She shuffles slowly about her tavern,
taking orders, making drinks and chatting with the few people who come
into the tavern from the village of Felder nearly a quarter mile down the
marsh road. Madame Ilista spits between her fingers often to keep the
evils of the moors away. The old woman refuses to go out after dark, and
she warns PCs not to do so. Several villagers are still missing after the
gray mists rolled across the moors. She wears a silver necklace to ward
off spirits.
The moors are alive with nocturnal animals rustling the plants.
Numerous small ponds dot the open fields, with bogbean and cinquefoil
growing abundantly on the dark waters. Moneywort and clubmoss fill the
fields. Nightshade grows in clumps. A lichenthrope wolf made entirely of
deadly nightshade stalks the moors, attacking and transforming villagers
into deadly plant animals. The lichenthrope hunts during the full moon
and attacks by rising out of the marshy plants to spring on its victims. It
usually waits until the mists cover much of the moors before leaping to

Linnorms look like massive serpents with draconic heads. Linnorms
never speak, nor do they have spell-casting ability. Linnorms attack with
their bite which deals grievous damage and injects a deadly poison into
their opponents (save or die). A linnorm may also constrict an opponent
for 3d4 points of damage per round. If a linnorm attacks with its bite and
4 or more than the number needed in rolled on its attack dice, the victim is
swallowed whole. Swallowed victims suffer 2d4 hit points of damage per
round and may only strike back at the linnorm with short weapons. The
inside of a linnorm is considered armor class 8[11].
Linnorms share the size categories and age categories of dragons. They
are deaf, detecting heat and vibration, and are therefore unaffected by
silence and invisibility. Thrice per day, linnorms may breathe a cloud of
poisonous gas 30ft long, 20ft wide, and 10ft high, which deals damage
equal to the linnorm’s full hit points (save for half damage). Linnorms may
not be subdued and are immune to poison. They are excellent swimmers
and sometimes lair in or near large bodies of water.

Worms on the Waterfront

The halfling inventor Ollie Nematod made a huge mistake. His plan to
sail his ship along the waters of Halfordness’ north coast to watch the giant
linnorms cavorting in the waves and sand instead drew the attention of the
massive worm-like creatures. The spawning ground is a deadly spot for
anyone to visit given the multitude of linnorms congregating there each
year. Ollie’s sightseeing expedition was going perfectly as the ship sailed
outside the churning waters where the linnorms swam. Ollie watched the
great worms using a spyglass of his own creation.
Everything changed when he dropped the metal-and-glass contraption
into the ocean. The sound of the spyglass hitting the waves caused a
number of the worms to swim out to investigate. The ship’s captain set sail
immediately, turning the three-master for port in a desperate bid to outrun
the approaching worms. It almost worked. But the first sight of the giant
linnorms rising near Halfordness’ pier caused panic on the waterfront.
Soon enough, 3 linnorms crawled ashore, driving terrified residents
before them through the cobblestone streets.

Leaping Lions

The streets of Bards Bottom are empty, and the doors and windows
of the small cottages are shut and locked tight. People move inside their
homes, but no one opens their doors to strangers. A few brave souls crack
their shutters to warn PCs to get off the road before the cats see them.
They tell PCs to steer clear of the tavern on the hill.
The Bard’s Call tavern sits empty. Its door is splintered, and giant claw
marks mar the wooden posts holding up the covered porch. A pride of 5
lions that escaped from a magic-user’s zoo now lives inside the tavern.
The animals wear collars that let them dimension door forward with each
leap, essentially doubling their movement. Residents are trapped in their
homes, unable to escape without attracting the lions’ attention. Visitors
find themselves flanked by the lions as they hunt new prey.

Lithonnites are huge mollusk-like creatures, about one ton in weight,
living in subterranean and surface environments. The front of a lithonnite’s
body is encased in a powerful shell, even to the rock-like eyelids. When
the rest of the lithonnite’s body is concealed in a grotto or under water,
the shell appears like a boulder or other natural rock. It is not possible for
the lithonnite to draw its soft body entirely into the shell. In combat, the
lithonnite reaches around its shell with two slug-like tentacles to attack.
The creature’s frontal portion, protected by the shell, can be attacked by
any sort of weapon; behind the shell, the soft body is AC 6[13], but cannot
be affected by blunt weapons due to its boneless consistency.

Island in the Stream

Cool water drips from the algae-covered walls of this underground
grotto. A river runs through the dark caverns, surging out of the cavern
wall before vanishing back underground. The rocky shore is alive with
albino crabs and crayfish that crawl over one another in a mad scramble
of claws and shells. The clacking of their pinchers is loud in the still room.
A massive boulder in the center of the underground river is covered with
hundreds more of the crustaceans. The current pushes the body of an elf
against the boulder, the rushing water holding the corpse in place against
the stone. The crabs scuttle over the body, picking at its flesh. The elf
wears waterlogged leather armor.
The boulder is a lithonnite that crawled up from the depths into this
cavern. The lithonnite brought a host of albino crabs with it. The lithonnite
killed the elf when he waded into the stream to search the rock. The elf
carries a pouch on his belt that contains 43 gp, a flat stone with the initials
L.C. carved into it, and a small journal he kept about his adventures. A
crude map to a lost treasure is drawn inside the cover of the leather journal.

Warrior Lizards Marching Off to War

The sound of bugles rises through the countryside, and the marching
feet of an army on the move can be heard around the bend. But the group
that marches into view is not human in the least. Instead, a vanguard of
9 lizard samurai marches in unison around a massive ko’haai. On the
massive lizard’s back is a howdah where an obese lizard samurai lounges
on plush cushions as it rides leisurely along.
A line of 20 human and elf slaves are chained to the howdah and march
miserably along behind the ko’haai. A female elf slave sits beside the
leader lizard, feeding him small white mice from a covered silver bowl.
The lizard samurai are marching from a lizardman colony in the Sin Mire
Swamp to the Seething Jungle where they plan to beseech the snake-like
ophidians for aid against the humans of Mirerest. The slaves following in
the lizards’ wake are gifts for the snake men. The lizard samurai attack
anyone the encounter on the road.

Broad Head, No Tail

A large wriggling tail lies pinned to the ground by four sharp stakes
attached to a bent sapling. The spiked tree trap punctures the tail, pinning
it to the ground. The spikes are driven deeply into the dirt. Trees and
brambles surround the open area. Very little blood dots the ground around
the tail, and it appears that the tail pulled cleanly away from whatever it
had been attached to. The remains of a half-eaten goat lie on the ground
near the tail.
The tail is from a broad-headed skink giant lizard that triggered a
trap set by hunters. The angry, tailless lizard hides in the brambles. It
charges out to attack anyone bothering its old tail.

Lightning in a Bottleneck

Steep cliffs rise around the tight stone walls of the Khypher Pass. The
high walls shroud the rocky trail in deep shadows. Constant storms cover
the area, drawn by the high amounts of metal found in the rocks. Lightning
blasts out of the black, roiling clouds overhead. Jagged bolts strike the
stone with loud resounding booms that echo throughout the canyon.
Boulders blasted off the cliffs nearly block the pass, forcing travelers to
wind around or climb over them.
The cliffs are home to 6 flying lightning lizards that launch themselves
off the rock walls to descend on potential prey. Travelers using the pass
find themselves blasted by streams of lightning as the lizards soar overhead
before landing to attack. If the fight goes against the lizards, they climb
back up the sheer rock walls to escape. In one of the caves at the top of
the cliff is the body of a dead traveler. The dwarf’s beard is singed off by
electricity, his bald head burned black by the blast. He has a +2 hammer
hanging from his belt.

A mockingbird’s call rises above the Sin Mire, the sound echoed and

circle travelers. Frogs munch the swarms of gnats, flies and mosquitoes
that rise from the murky waters. Deep splashes signal alligators diving
into the marsh.
A band of 12 lizardmen hunts throughout the Sin Mire with 2 giant
crocodiles. The group moves slowly and methodically as the lizards
search every inch of the vast morass. The walking lizards use the grass
and mud of the swamp to hide their scaly bodies from the dwarven city
of Anvil Plunge built on the edge of the mire. The lizardmen seek a relic
lost long ago to the swamp’s expanding borders. The silver lizard statue is

The Lobster-Giants are strange and rare creatures, living in swamps
and remote coastal shallows. They are not related either to giants or to
lobsters, save for the fact that they are indeed a bizarre form of intelligent
(albeit somewhat stupid) crustaceans. In addition to a pair of large pincers,
lobster-giants have a ridge of smaller “arms” along the length of the
underbelly, and these smaller limbs are coated with a paralytic poison.
Lobster-Giants attack with their two pincers, and if they succeed in
hitting an opponent with both pincers, they have also managed to grab
hold and hug the opponent to their chests, where the smaller limbs can
scrabble through armor and scratch with the poison. A victim who has
been grabbed will suffer an additional 2d6 attacks, and for of these that
hits a saving throw is required to avoid being paralyzed for 1d10 turns. A
character is allowed to attempt breaking out of the giant’s pincer-grip each
round, which is done by rolling 4d6. If the resulting number is equal to or
lower than the character’s strength, the character has escaped.

The One That Should Have Gotten Away

Three bodies lie on Bargarsport’s waterfront pier. The corpses are
crushed into nearly unrecognizable lumps. Blood drains along the wooden
planks and into the water below, attracting 4 sharks into the shallows
beneath the pier. Nets hanging along the pier are sliced apart, spilling piles
of rotting fish across the dock. One of the large piles shifts slowly, sending
fish raining into the water.
A lobster-giant came ashore recently, lured by the smell of the day’s
catch sitting in great nets along the dock. The lobster-giant crushed
the morning fishermen, then slashed open nets strung up on the dock
containing the catch unloaded that morning by a fishing vessel. The
smelly haul dropped atop the lobster-giant. It still sits beneath the fish
pile, munching happily on cod and tuna. The lobster-giant bursts out of the
pile in a shower of gore, scales and bone to attack PCs.

To Kill a King

A wooden throne sits on a dais in the center of this empty and longunused throne room. Sculpted stone faces adorn the walls. Each head is
five foot tall from brow to chin and has a permanent magic mouth on it
that allows the face to speak a series of programmed phrases. The heads
offer motivationally uplifting words meant for royal ears.
A skeleton lies facedown on the floor before the throne. The bones
are wrapped in silk clothing and have a long purple robe that leaves just
the head and arms exposed. Looking under the robe reveals crushed and
broken bones. The body is all that remains of Mad King Manalcris, a
ruler whose vanity caused his kingdom to crumble until he was left in his
empty castle listening to the words of his stone-faced “advisers.”
The high ceiling is home to the king’s killer: a ceiling lurker. The
lurker drops on anyone investigating the skeletal remains. It feeds on
those who enter the castle looking for forgotten treasures. Its past meals
can be found slumped in various parts of the castle. All of their bones are
crushed and broken from the lurker’s embrace.

The Silver Glove

A falling-down wooden shack stands amid a grove of oak trees. The
shack’s walls are warped, and its flat roof buckles in the middle where a
tree branch grows out of the structure. The oak trees support a covered
porch that wraps around the building. The bark on the trees is rubbed off
and lies in splintered bits on the porch deck. The shack’s door is painted
bright red. Inside the cabin, an old man sits in a comfortable rocking
chair by a large pot-belly stove. His wide grin shows his many teeth as he
welcomes visitors. He wraps his tiny frame in a large bearskin blanket for
warmth. Candles melting in clay pots provide light.
A magical gauntlet sits on a credenza beside the door. The gauntlet
glows with a soft silver light and grants the wearer the ability to see in
the dark. It comes with a downside, however, as it turns the wearer into a
werebear within a year if he fails a saving throw.
The old man is Urlak the Great, the owner – and victim – of the glove.
He’s a friendly sort unless angered. If someone touches the glove (or gives
it too many glances), he throws the bearskin rug away and gets up in the
PC’s face. His scrawny body doesn’t pose much of a threat, but if pushed
he changes to his werebear form and attacks.

Pig in a Poke

Two shifty looking dwarves struggle down a dark alley in Bargarsport.
They carry a large rolled up carpet between them as they stagger into the
darkness. The rug struggles weakly in their grasp, causing them to drop it
every so often. The pair occasionally beat the rug senseless before picking
it up again and moving on.
Kazlach and Stroog are slave traders who abduct people off the street
and deliver them to the waterfront slave ships. The pair wait in the alleys
and ambush passers-by. Kazlach smacks victims over the head, and Stroog
catches them in the unrolled rug. Their last victim, however, refuses to get
carried off to his fate in peace. The man keeps waking up, threatening to
draw attention to the dwarf slavers. Extra beatings aren’t helping, and only
seem to be making the man madder. The dwarves are ready to abandon
their plan and just kill the man unless PCs intervene.
Anyone unrolling the carpet is in for quite a shock. The semiconscious

Rat’s Revenge

The village of Illmoor sits along a quiet tributary of the Quall River.
The farmers are all retired human fighters (the youngest is in his 80s) who
found peace in this idyllic village carved out among the plentiful ash trees.
Wading birds nest along the slow-moving river, and deer are plentiful in
the woods. The warriors hunt and fish to pass the time.
But there’s a rat in the village. Or, more specifically, a lot of rats.
Illmoor’s mayor recently discovered that the communal grain bin near his
farm is infested with hundreds of normal rats. The miller found a similar
problem: 6 giant rats moved in overnight to feast on his grain. With
winter fast approaching, the rats are eating up food the villagers stored to
get them through the coldest months. Residents even complain they are
finding rats in their cellars gnawing at their personal supplies.
A recent addition to the town is the root of the problem. Faragin Gorl
is a wererat who discovered that one of the old men slew his pack brother.
The vengeful Faragin is taking his revenge on the entire town. He sends
the rats on missions to make life miserable, and plans to eventually infect
the villagers with lycanthropy to start his own wererat nest. Faragin lives
in a small guest house on the mayor’s land. The villagers think he is a
traveling woodsman looking for work.

Hunter Games

Bloody leaves and clawed trees mark the boundary of a deadly sixsquare-mile hunting ground used by the rakshasa Tunis el-Cine and
his companion, the weretiger Mellina Curdil. The pair abduct people
from Bordig’s Basin, a river community whose growing presence is
depleting the forest’s deer population, and bring them to the center of the
game preserve. The pair gives the villagers an hour’s head start (if they
are feeling generous) and then hunt the unfortunate victims through the
rugged terrain.
Mellina is a comely woman who uses her charms to lure men into
the woods. She wears a silver tiger brooch that contains red lipstick that
causes anyone she kisses to fall asleep if they fail a saving throw. Those
who fall asleep are taken into the deep woods where they awaken a day
later with the vicious hunters standing over them. The skeletons of Tunis
and Mellina’s victims are scattered throughout the forest. The couple
play with their prey as they chase them through the woods. They’ve also
rigged deadfalls and covered pits throughout the forest to make things
more interesting. If their prey escapes outside the blood boundary, they
can go free (again, if the hunters are feeling generous). No one has lived
through the horrible hunt yet.

King Weasel

A redwood tree in the Kajaani Forest is hollow, carved out by woodboring insects that infested the tree before dying off during the harsh
winter. The tree contains spacious rooms and corridors that wind randomly
up throughout the 80-foot-diameter trunk. Dead beetle husks fill many of
the lower chambers like a crunching carpet. Natural knots in the wood
allow for easy climbing inside the tree as natural tunnels wind and twist in
every direction. The tree’s bark is covered in the dry husks of thousands
of voracious beetles.
Marley Von Torgen, an eccentric wereweasel, considers himself king
of the forest and all of its inhabitants. He dresses in silk robes and wears
a platinum crown (100 gp). He addresses visitors from a thick branch 30
feet off the ground. He demands tribute from PCs in the amount of 200 gp
per person. If ignored, he orders 8 giant weasels to attack. The weasels
hide inside piles of beetle husks scattered around the base of the tree.

A 20-foot-tall mirror reflects the black walls of this sloping chamber.
Unfinished marble statues stand throughout the room. Each sculpture faces
the massive mirror. One statue holding a crystal ball in its outstretched
hand appears to be trying to drop the ball into a shallow depression atop
a 4-foot-tall stone pillar standing at the base of the mirror. Five glowing
braziers stand each side of the room.
The mirror reflects the chamber and statues, but anyone making a
saving throw realizes there are more statues in the mirror than in the
room. If the crystal ball is removed from the statue’s hand and placed
into the depression, the mirror flickers and the missing statues reappear
in the room. Each new statue wears a jeweled necklace and crown. These
baubles are worth 2,400 gp total if removed from the statues. The old
statues in the room don’t have the jewels or crowns.
Besides the statues, the werewolf Aldus Max also returns when the
statues are summoned. Aldus has been trapped in the mirror world for five
years. He wears a ring of invisibility that allows him to remain invisible.
The werewolf is insane after his years in exile and attacks anyone stealing
the jewels from his statue “friends.”
If the crystal ball is removed from the pillar, anyone in the chamber
must make a saving throw or be drawn into the mirror trap and imprisoned.
The statue holding the crystal ball is a stone golem whose sole task is to
retrieve the globe 2d8 rounds after it is removed from its hands.

If a giant lynx hits with both of its front claws, it can make 2 more attacks
with its rear claws. These large cats are found in the cold wilderness, where
they hide in trees waiting for prey, then leap to the attack. They are highly
intelligent, and can communicate with each other when coordinated action
is needed. As with the common lynx, giant lynx are well camouflaged, and
if waiting in ambush they will surprise opponents (5 in 6 chance).

Beak and Claw

The dirt covering Farmer Emil Rodger’s fields are churned and
trampled. Blood puddles around the bodies of 15 emus that have been
ripped apart in their fenced-in pen. The giant birds’ necks and bodies are
shredded and gnawed. Many are missing entire wings. The farmer and his
wife are heartbroken. They hatched the birds from eggs, and raised them
for years as their children.
The farm sits on land a roaming pride of lynxes visits every couple
of years. The giant birds lasted less than a day once the vicious cats
converged on the farm. The pride sleeps under a rock overhang in the
forest. They return to the farm each night, looking for more easy meals.
The 8 lynxes skulk about the homestead, their bright eyes glittering in the
darkness. The farmer and his terrified wife beg for help. They claim that
demonic screams arise around the farm each night.

Polly Really Wants a Cracker

River captain Tomas Bale plies the Quall River in the Obsidian
Barnacle, a flat boat that has seen its share of trouble. The goodly captain’s
trade route brings various trade goods to the river cities along the Quall,
where he unloads one cargo and loads another for the next stop. He
frequently hires deckhands, as his men tire quickly of the mindlessly dull
routine trips. He welcomes PCs aboard with a slap on the back and the
promise of adventure (his current crew groans after this pronouncement).
The Barnacle’s current cargo is crates of dried bread Bale is bringing
downriver to Bargarsport. The farmers use the crumbled bread to feed
their chickens and to season their soups. A few of the crates split open
during as they were loaded, letting the bread grow stale and spill across
the shifting boat as it rides the river currents.
The dried bread attracts 4 giant macaws that swoop out of the trees
to get at the tasty treat. The birds attack the crates with beaks and claws,
ripping apart the wood to get at the crackers stashed inside. The birds
attack anyone getting between them and their prize.

Malcarnae are female creatures with a four-armed human torso and the
lower body of a great, writhing serpent, fifteen feet long. These horrible
creatures are one of the many possible teratomorphs that may result from
human congress with demons, most commonly an incubus. In some cases
they may also be hatched from clutches of eggs laid by Marilith demons
following events too hideous to contemplate. When they are born into any
but the most depraved human societies they are usually killed at birth,
so they are seldom found upon the material planes. Malcarnae generally
arm themselves with a shield and three weapons, and can also attack with
their lashing tails for 1d8 points of damage. Despite the horrible shape of
these creatures, they are obscenely beautiful; creatures of fewer than 4
hit dice cannot attack them, and opponents with 4 or more hit dice must
make a saving throw to succeed with any attempted physical attack. They
are immune to normal weapons (other than silver ones) and have magic
resistance of 25%. The human parentage of the malcarnae prevents them
from being turned by a cleric. Some malcarnae may have clerical spell
casting ability.

Forest of the Dead

Deformed trees grow from the briars and brambles of the Redstain
Forest, their leafless branches intertwining in a thicket overhead. Trunks
grow at twisted angles so that some trees appear bent nearly sideways.
Spikes grow naturally from the bark of many of the deformed trees.
Impaled on these spikes are decaying torsos, severed heads and the
skeletal remains of various humanoids. Squirrels, moles and deer are
similarly impaled and gutted. Blood seeps down the trees to soak into the
odd-shaped roots.
The forest is home to a colony of malcarnae that hunt the hundreds
of square miles they consider their domain. Cast out by their horrified
parents, the malcarnae destroy all living things venturing into their
territory. Trespassers are guaranteed to meet warbands of 6 malcarnae
who stalk their prey through the dead forest. They pass silently through
the deep woods, using owl calls to communicate. Anything caught by the
vicious snake-women ends up impaled on the tree spikes. The malcarnae
colony is located deep in the forest’s interior. It is led by a marilith named
Virgris Drees. Despite the surrounding forest, the village is a place of
beauty where flowering plants and climbing vines are molded into artistic
creations.

Malformians are the result of magical breeding experiments. They are
ugly human-like creatures, often of misshapen proportions, crossbred
by insane wizards from humans, goblinoids, animals, and even beings
summoned from other worlds. No two malformians look alike; one
might be covered in warts and tufts of fur, a second might have useless
atrophied wings growing from its back, a third might have eyes and
hands of mismatched sizes, and so on. Their various deformities tend to
hinder their movement. Any weapons and possessions will be makeshift
in nature, such as clubs, staves, crudely stitched cloaks, etc. Gangs of
malformians make hideouts in wilderness ruins or subterranean lairs; they
do not interact with civilization except as occasional predators and raiders.

Weight of the Wild

The pelts of various forest animals are staked to trees and wedged
into rock piles throughout this stretch of the Kajaani Forest. Pelts hang
at all heights throughout the aged trees, but lack any discernible pattern
as to their placement. No bones or other remains can be found, although
evidence of where the creatures were skinned lies all over the ground.
An oversized scale hangs from the thick bough of a sturdy oak farther
into the forest. The scale’s two brass plates are supported by vines
and ropes rising into the branches overhead. One empty brass plate is
suspended three feet off the ground, while the other hovers a foot above the
dirt. The lower plate is loaded with skinned animal carcasses. Congealed
blood pools in the 10-foot-diameter brass dish. The scale hums with raw
magical energy.
The forest is home to a gang of 15 malformians who protect their
“creator.” An insane magic-user designed the scale to change enemies
into animals. If 100 pounds of dead animals are piled onto one brass
plate, the opposite changes the victim into that animal (save avoids). The
malformians unfortunately toss every animal they kill and skin onto the
scale. Currently, the lowered plate holds 30 pounds of remains, giving
the raised plate a 30% chance of changing anyone touching it into a
malformian if they fail a saving throw. The malformians are immune to
the change, and fight beneath and around the raised brass plate in hopes
attackers stumble into the strange device.

An Elephant Never Forgets

The longhall is rowdy, with barbarians tossing hunks of meat across
the U-shaped wooden table sitting in the center of the room. The men
and women wear animal skins and bear furs lie on the ground around
the revelers. A roaring fire keeps the room’s temperature stifling, pressing
back the cold chill that blows through the double doors whenever someone
rises to stagger out into the snow. Most of the simple wooden chairs have
elk antlers mounted on their high backs, but two seats for the tribe’s leader
and his wife are much grander. They have wooden slats placed on two sets
of giant curved tusks to form giant rocking chairs.
The snow barbarians kill mammoths for meat and decorations. The tusks
belonged to a mated pair killed months ago. The remaining 6 mammoths
from the herd remember the attack, however, and track the hunters to their
hall. The angry mammoths stomp through the wooden wall, trying to
squash anyone using the tusk chairs and eating the mammoth meat.

Deadly Attraction

A dome of mismatched shields clanks and shudders as it moves slowly
down this dirt road. Iron spikes jut from the shields, punching through the
metal in places. Wheels can be seen beneath the contraption, and curving
slits in the shields reveal a halfling inside pushing the device forward. The
halfling inventor Ollie Nematoad is testing his latest creations: manticore
attractors and repellants. He has two bottles inside the shields surrounding
him. He believes that one attracts manticores (it does) and that the other
repels them (it doesn’t). He opened the first bottle as he began pushing the
mobile shield wall down the road near a known manticore lair.
In 1d4+1 rounds, 2 manticore arrive, angry and ready for battle. The
musky attractor overwhelms the manticores’ noses, making them attack
with abandon. The spikes on the shields are remnants of Ollie’s last
encounter with one of the creatures. He didn’t get to test the repellant
before that creature was killed by passing adventurers. He sprays the
second repellent wildly as battle begins around him. Anyone breathing
in the second spray must make a saving throw or be overcome by a
sneezing fit.

Ghostly Prayers

A ring of ghostly figures kneels around a rotting oak tree stump rising
out of the ground. The stump is slashed and gouged, and the bark has
fallen away so that it vaguely resembles a leering face. The ghostly
men, women and children sway to an unheard melody rising from the
stump. The ghosts’ forms are slashed and battered; three of the figures
are missing heads. The sounds of insects are loud in the forest ringing
the small clearing. A broken down covered wagon sits on the edge of the
clearing. It appears a horse kicked its way out of the harness holding it to
the vehicle.
The ghosts are victims of a giant praying mantis that killed a family
that had stopped to picnic around the stump. Their spirits linger here,
unable to move on until the praying mantis is killed. The insect lurks
inside the wagon. The insect leaps out to grab fresh meat. The bones of
the travelers lie discarded among the tree roots. The wagon contains the
family’s belongings, including a +1 dagger hidden inside a cookie jar
rolling around the wooden floor. Two beds are slashed and ripped, their
stuffing scattered across the interior.

Game Time

An oversized chessboard stands in the middle of this luxurious garden.
The board’s dark squares are black dahlias while the lighter squares are
white hydrangeas. The marble chess pieces sitting on the board are six feet
tall and weigh approximately 500 pounds each. A game appears to be well
underway, although the players are nowhere to be found.
The black and white humanoid chess pieces (2 kings, 2 queens, 4
bishops and 4 knights) are 12 Marrosian statues playing their own game
to decide a past squabble between their creators. Each side gets one move
per day, with the king moving the “non-living” pieces (pawns and rooks).
If the game is interrupted by PCs trying to move pieces, the statues don’t
react. They return to their spots after PCs leave the board. Once the current
game finishes, however, the 12 game pieces track down the offenders. If
PCs try to destroy the statues, all 12 animate immediately and attack. They
return to their squares once the threat is dealt with.

A clockwork cavalier is a metallic humanoid (usually plated with
tarnished bronze), elaborately forged to resemble a handsome, mustached
gentleman, with a winding mechanism (a key) in its back between the
shoulder blades, and armed with a sword extending from its right forearm.
Once it has been wound up, the cavalier will wait in place until it can
perceive a male humanoid armed with a sword, whom it will challenge to
fight a duel to the death. If the opponent declines, the cavalier will accuse
him with cowardice, and attack the following round. During combat the
Cavalier will mock its opponent with a selection of insults and taunts.
Any other combatants striking the Cavalier will also become targets. A
Cavalier never flees from a fight.
The cavalier grows slower as it winds down. Each successive round
it is in combat it gains a -1 to hit and to its movement rate. Eventually it
comes to a complete halt (once movement rate reaches 0, in 12 rounds)
and is thereafter totally unable to move or fight (although the insults
continue for a further 1d4 rounds). Clockwork cavaliers are immune to
Sleep, Charm and Hold, and to all non-magical piercing weapons. Any
two-handed sword or axe that hits has a 1 in 6 chance of beheading the
Cavalier - which causes it to halt and then explode within the next round
(burst radius 20ft, 1d6 damage - a successful saving throw means that a
person caught in the blast only takes half damage).

The Girl in the Fireplace

An ancient capuchin monkey with a long white beard of untrimmed fur
walks slowly down the royally decorated hallway of Pompadour Pointe.
The castle is a sprawling complex, but the monkey appears to be the only
creature inside it. The monkey drags a heavy silver key down the stone
corridor. The central ballroom is an opulent chamber with cream-colored
marble tiles on the floor and a majestic staircase rising to a balcony that
runs around the entire room. Ten-foot-tall mirrors stand evenly spaced
along the walls like windows. The monkey walks slowly across the empty
dance floor toward a grandfather clock.
While the room is empty, the mirrors tell a different story: Each shows
dancers twirling across the floor, moving to unheard music. A band in the
corner provides the tune. The dancers wear large white wigs and paint
their faces alabaster. A girl sits in the mirror world’s six-foot-tall fireplace,
writing with her finger in the ash filling the hearth. Anyone looking in the
real fireplace finds the words “Help Us” written there. The monkey climbs
a wooden grandfather clock standing off to the side of the room. It inserts
the key into a hole in the clock’s face. It doesn’t turn the key.
The key activates 4 clockwork cavaliers residing in the mirror realm.
If the key is turned, the clockwork cavaliers step out of the mirrors. The
mechanisms attack anyone wielding a weapon. If the mirrors are broken,
the dancers scream as the shards of glass crash to the floor. In 1d4 rounds,
the dancers stagger out of the ashes of the fireplace, returned to the real
world from which the clockwork cavaliers abducted them centuries ago.

The Robot’s Hearts

A quarter-mile plane of obsidian sits atop the burning sands of the
Kanderi Desert. This featureless plateau reflects the heat of the midday
sun, and cools slowly overnight. A 30-foot-tall-by-20-foot-diameter
metal cylinder rises in the center of the opaque plane. The metal tube
has no doors or windows. A series of numbered dials are attached to the
tube’s side. The dials cannot be turned by hand, but each begins counting
downward if a PC touches the metal cylinder. The tube reacts to the pulse
of living beings, and the dials decrease toward zero with each heartbeat.
If multiple PCs touch the tube simultaneously, the dials spin toward zero
all the faster. The dials continue counting down even if PCs remove their
hands from the tube’s surface.
When the dials reach zero (in 2d6 rounds), the tube opens with a
pneumatic hiss and a blast of scalding steam. A giant robot mechanism
steps from the enclosure and targets the creatures whose heartbeats
released it. The giant robot chases creatures across the desert. Its passage
over the desert turns the sand to glass. The robot returns to its tube when
the PCs (and their annoying heartbeats) are dead. The robot scoops out the
heart of any PC it kills. The hearts are collected in a basket on its back. A
number of dried lumps still sit in the basket from past victims.

Iron cobras are a type of eldritch mechanism, created by the great

tomes of knowledge. They are jointed constructions of iron, the size of
a normal cobra, that slither and attack as commanded (perhaps eons in

Pipe Snakes

Hundreds of iron pipes jut from the earthen walls of this dungeon
chamber beneath the wizard Imregar’s Iron Tower. The pipes crisscross
the room in a metal lattice hovering near the 10-foot-high ceiling. Steam
bursts from angled joints in many of the connected pipes, and the sound
of water rushing through others is quite loud. Some pipes have frost built
up around their outer surface and do 1 hp of damage to anyone touching
the metal with exposed skin. Others radiate heat and deal 1 hp of damage.
The pipes carry water into the tower, and waste out of it. The room is
protected by 10 iron cobra mechanisms that hide among the pipes. The
iron cobras are difficult to spot (1 in 6 chance) while stationary. They drop
onto PCs passing beneath them. A couple of the hollow cobras actually
serve as waste pipes. Anyone bitten by them runs the risk of contracting a
wasting disease the does 1d4 points of damage each day until cured (save

Snake Oil

The sanctum of this jungle temple contains a 60-foot-wide square pool
filled with glistening oil. Seven columns rise out of the pool to support a
painted ceiling. Oils winds down the columns into the pool, flowing from
spigots high on the columns. Pictures of snakes are painted on the walls
around the sanctuary. The pool is surprisingly deep, dropping to a stone
floor nearly 40 feet down. The opaque oil makes it difficult to see more
than a few feet into the slippery substance.
The oil is not flammable, but it does have one unique property: It
allows anyone immersed in it to breathe normally for one hour in any
environment (underwater, oil, dirt, etc.). The temple is home to a yellowand-crimson scaled medusa named Eld’mos-oth Quill. The creature
swims in the pool to keep her scales supple. Any visitors succumbing
to her gaze are dropped into the oil. Currently, 9 statues of men, women,
dwarves and elves stand on the bottom of the oil pool. The medusa senses
the vibrations of people walking about the temple above and bursts out of
the oil bath, hoping to surprise people into looking her in the eye.

The Melgara (singular and plural) are a humanoid race from an
alternate world. They appear to be tall, slender, blue-skinned women,
dressed in silvery-grey robes and sandals, with long pale hair, and slitted
eyes. They have six digits per extremity, plus an extra thumb on the left
hand, and live for 200 to 350 years. All members of the Melgara race
are mystical and introspective by nature, given to meditating upon
philosophy, cosmology, and emotional awareness. They consider most
other races to be psychologically impaired, and will communicate with
them as condescending parents or teachers to slow or stunted children.
The Melgara arm themselves with staffs and wands of a strange, durable
crystal found on their world. The staff deals 2d4 damage. The wand, when
used as a striking weapon, deals 1d4 damage in addition to 1d4 rounds of
a Slowing effect or a Stunning effect (saving throw negates). The Melgara
can also channel mental energy through these crystal weapons (3 times
per day), causing any one of the following more powerful effects with
a successful Attacks: (1) Paralysis for 1 turn, (2) Sleep for 1 hour, or (3)
Charm for 1 full day. Each member of the race has spell ability equal to a
cleric of level 2, and some have spell casting ability of up to level 5. They
do not, however, have the ability to turn undead. In addition to clerical
spell casting, all melgara can cast the magic-user spells sleep, shield, blur,
and ESP, although these spells take up a clerical spell “slot”. Once per day,
they can increase their own speed, allowing a bonus of 2 to armor class
(AC 5[14]). In any group of melgara, one will possess a crystal pendant or
silvery rod of unusual design. These items have no combat function, being
ceremonial devices on the Melgaran homeworld.

No Shoes Allowed

An amethyst gem nearly three feet tall stands upright from a natural
rock formation inside a cave hidden in the high peaks of the Hollow Spire
Mountains. The amethyst pulses with an inner light, its glow bathing the
interior of the cave in purplish colors. A row of sandals sits just inside the
cave mouth. Low wooden benches sit along the granite wall. The cave
slopes upward into a sanctuary where a 200-foot-long crystal dominates
the chamber. Twelve acolytes sit on the floor around the crystal, their eyes
turned toward its gleaming depths. They hum in unison, their eyes closed
as they meditate. The men and women refuse to move or utter a word.
The cave is home to a tall, blue-skinned woman wearing silvery-grey
robes and sandals. Her eyes are slitted, and she has long pale hair. Her name
is Queessetumdyn. The melgara is teaching her acolytes patience and
understanding, and she takes offense to adventurers interrupting the daily
meditation. Especially if they don’t remove their shoes. Queessetumdyn
greets them with staff and wand, and refuses to talk until PCs remove their
footwear. Her strikes tend to be against the lower legs to make her point.
Anyone sitting for a month with the melgara gains the ability to divine
one question from nature at any point in the next three months. Her
patience is short, however, and PCs can expect many whacks from the

Snap-Snatcher

The hunters of the northernmost forests share that terrain with many
strange and dangerous beasts. One such predator is the melhukiskata, or
“sap snatcher.”
So stealthy is the melhukiskata that it is rare for one to be spotted on the
move. Those who have seen them report that its body is three feet long,
shaped like a weasel or badger, but can walk like a bear. It is covered
with shaggy, grey-brown fur all over, down to the tip of its two-foot long
tail. Its mouth is elongated and oddly eel-like, while its feet are wickedly
taloned. The most unusual features of the beast, though, are its fingers
-- for instead of forepaws, the melhukiskata has fingered hands. Odder
still, the fingers are long and stiff, and grow out like antlers. The longest
of these antler-like fingers yet seen on a melhukiskata were five feet long.
The sap on the hands holds fast anyone touched and also is a weakening
contact poison (save vs. poison or lose 1d6 points of strength per round,
causing loss of consciousness at 2 strength or lower). Anyone so held can
be automatically bitten each round and will be held until the melhukiskata
is killed, the adhesive is burned away, or is washed off with vinegar or
alcohol. All lost points of strength will be regained in 1d6 hours.
Tracking the melhukiskata is difficult, for when it does travel it often
walks backwards, dragging its huge fingers behind it as if to sweep away its
trail. Perhaps because of this so many folktales describe the melhukiskata
as a clever animal. More likely, such behavior is instinctive. In no other
regard does it appear to be smarter than a dog.

Forest Saps

Piles of orange, red and yellow leaves rest on the ground around maple
trees filling this forest. Spigots are tapped into many of the tree trunks, the
valves dripping syrup into wooden buckets. Sap also runs from multiple
slashes running around the bases of each trunk. The sap is mainly from the
trees, but mixed into the syrupy runoff is a contact poison that requires a
saving throw vs. poison or the person touching it loses 1 point of strength
per round until he loses consciousness at 2 strength.
The trees were slashes by 2 mated melhukiskatas as they marked
their territory. The creatures’ sticky hand sap mingled with the sap in the
trees to create the contact poison. The sap-snatchers have a lair beneath
the roots of a discolored maple tree. The entrance is covered by a pile
of multicolored leaves. The sap-snatchers’ stick their fingers out of the
leaves. The elongated fingers look like gnarled branches sticking out of
the leaf pile. Anyone touching the branches is dragged into the root lair
and attacked.

Mephits are minor spirits usually related to fire and heat, that can, from time to time, be loosed on the Material Planes by natural means

Flame Bringer

The dwarven forges of Orecrush were abandoned during the Time of
Terrible Rains that flooded the lower Mines. The furnaces ceased for the
first time in centuries as the dwarves moved their forges aboveground
to the city of Anvil Plunge. However, one forge still burns in the deep

tunnels. White-hot flames rage in the forge and burning coals pop and
sizzle inside the open hearth. A black opal sits amid the coals, white
flames ringing its spherical form.
The dwarves left the cursed opal in the burning forge to keep anyone
from possessing it. The opal is immersed in flames, and reaching in without
protection to grab it does 4d6 points of damage. The opal is worth 500 gp,
but possessing it comes at a cost: If the gem is removed from the forge’s
purifying flames, 1d4+3 fire mephits immediately leap from the fires to
attack. The mephits pursue PCs relentlessly until killed. Furthermore,
once per day the opal summons another 1d4+3 fire mephits whenever
it is brought within 100 feet of any open flame. The opal belonged to an
efreeti who lost it centuries ago to a dwarven thief. The mephits have been
seeking the gem for years so they may return it to their master.

This granite corridor ends in stone blocks that appear to separate in
the middle and slide to the sides. The blocks weigh nearly 1 ton apiece,
making them nearly impossible to push aside by hand. On the corridor’s
left wall are six holes situated at waist height. On the right wall are eight
holes at the same height. The six holes on the left wall have small handles
inside them that can be rotated. The six holes on the right closest to the
door contain a recessed button that can be pushed. A PC must put their
arm in the hole up to their elbow to find these buttons and levers. If the
buttons are pushed and the levers rotated in sequence, the stone blocks
slide apart to allow admittance to a small library of ancient scrolls.
The extra two holes on the right wall belong to a mimic imitating

The Bull Rushers

A clattering racket rumbles down the cobblestone road as a twowheeled chariot rolls along. Sixteen nearly naked men and women pull
the chariot, each gaunt figure connected to the vehicle with iron chains
and leather straps hooked around and through their naked flesh. The reins
run back to the chariot, where 2 minotaurs wielding barbed whips urge
the people forward. The minotaurs wear loin-cloths, and one has a white
cape fastened around its broad shoulders. Each has bells attached to the
tips of their wickedly sharp horns. Leather sacks hang off the sides of the
chariot. A pair of giant bull horns adorns the front of the chariot.
The minotaurs ride through the countryside, attacking travelers to add
to their slave train. The beasts leap from the chariot to attack. One of
the minotaurs wears a cloak of displacement. The people chained to the
chariot run until they drop, at which point the minotaurs replace them.
Three bags hanging from the chariot contain the minotaurs’ treasure: 424

use to open villages’ locked gates to get at the people inside. Six other
bags contain the butchered remains of pullers who died in harness. Among

Mirror fiends inhabit mirrors. They appear as emotionless humans
staring out of the reflective surface to the world beyond. If a mirror fiend
locks his gaze with someone looking into the mirror, the victim must make
a successful saving throw or have his soul sucked into the mirror, while his
body remains motionlessly staring at himself in the mirror. While within
the mirror, the victim’s actions are controlled by his immobilized self as
the mirror fiend attacks the victim’s mirror-self. The victim’s mirror-self
suffers -4 to his first attack due to being unfamiliar with the mirror-image
environment, but the penalty is reduced by 1 in each subsequent round.
Should the immobilized victim’s gaze be moved away from his mirrorself, he will no longer be able to control his movements within the mirror,
and the mirror-self will become a motionless target for the mirror fiend.
Slaying the mirror fiend will restore the victim’s soul to his body, but
shattering the mirror will forever trap the soul within the mirror. Mirror
fiends are immune to attacks from normal weapons, and are 50% resistant
to magic. Weapons used from outside will likely shatter the mirror, and
spells used from the outside will reflect back upon the caster rather than

To the Victor

The gladiatorial fights held in the Bloke & Dagger Tavern are a sensation
in the city of Taharath. The tavern’s center floorboards are pushed aside
three times each week to reveal a 30-foot-square gladiator pit beneath the
building. Competitors are paired up in bouts of skill to face off for the
title of champion. Mavis, the kindly owner and coordinator of the fights,
awards silver trophies and gold to the winners.
The magic-user Dagnum Corbett was humiliated during a recent bout.
The pompous mage thought to use a magic ring to boost his strength,
but Mavis caught on to the deception and had her bouncer take the ring.
Dagnum’s opponent pushed the scrawny mage into the sand-covered floor
and sat on him until the man submitted. Dagnum swore to get back at the
tavern and its cheering patrons, and devised a deadly scheme.
This week’s trophies contain a terrible surprise: Dagnum snared a

Mavis removes the purple cloth covering the traveling trophy, anyone
staring into the surface must make a saving throw or be drawn into the
mirror-realm to face the deadly mirror fiend.

protecting her remains. Blue mist flowers adorn her dark hair, and a sigil
of an eye is painted on her forehead in gray ash. Larisska Malive was a
warrior woman killed defending her king during a frost giant attack. Her
body was placed here to honor her short life. Paintings on the wall reveal
her incredible deeds.
Around the bier are six metal candelabras, each with a delicate
framework of silver wire atop the 6-foot-tall pole. The poles are anchored
into the stone floor to keep them from falling over. The frame atop each
pole contains a head-sized black globe. Light held behind the globes
reveals objects inside each one. PCs can make out rings, gems and coins
through the dark glass, but can’t see details. The globes cannot be removed
easily from the wire frames.
If any globe is shattered or broken free of its mounting, the metal
frames holding the other globes contract, cracking the remaining spheres
simultaneously. Voluminous gray mist billows out of each cracked globe
and forms into 6 mist men within 1d4 rounds. The items inside each globe
are generally worthless trinkets worth no more than 20 gp each. There is
a 20% chance that a random minor magic item could be mixed into the
lot, however. The mist men were placed here to stop grave robbers. The
trinkets in the glass were used to trap and contain the mist men.

The under tunnels of Bargarsport are passages dug through the hardened
mud that buried the old city during the great quake brought on by an angry

but six casks of fine wine can be salvaged and sold for 200 gp apiece.
The wooden racks holding the casks crumble if handled too roughly. Two

The cellar is located above a tunnel where 8 mogura-jin hunt. Two of
the mole-men tunneled up into the empty barrels and watch PCs holes in
the wooden slats. They signal the rest of their group to attack when the PCs

and much stronger a zombie.
Due to a mohrg’s blinding speed, these monsters will always attack first
during a combat round unless squared off against an opponent using some
sort of magic that increases the character’s own speed of motion (such as
boots of speed). Mohrgs have two possible methods of attacking. First,
the mohrg’s tongue extends five feet, and has a paralyzing effect. A saving
throw at -2 is permitted to avoid this effect, but victims failing the saving
throw are paralyzed for 1d6 turns. The morgh’s second option in combat
is to strike opponents with its fists. When the mohrg hits with its hands,
the strike not only causes damage, but allows the mohrg to hold on if the
victim fails a saving throw. A character who is so held cannot attack, and
if the mohrg hits with its tongue in a subsequent round, the tongue will hit
automatically (although the victim is still allowed a saving throw to avoid
paralysis). Any held character may break free with a successful saving
throw during the character’s attack initiative.
Any character killed by mohrg will rise after 1d4 days as a zombie
under the morhg’s control. Thus, mohrgs are often found accompanied
by 1d6 zombies.

The Mohrg the Merrier

This wooden house is a patchwork of bright colors. No two walls share
the same hues. Even the four square panels in the entry door are different
colors. The door is unlocked, and opens onto a gaily decorated foyer filled
with circus props and clown mannequins. Streaks of color lining the walls
lead into adjoining rooms. Each room is piled with colorful items such as
wooden rocking horses, giant blocks with letters and numbers painted on
them, and giant fortunetelling cards. Stuffed parrots hang in gilded cages
in one room, the birds numbering in the hundreds. One room is not as neat
as the others, and contains boxes of stage clothing. The boxes are tossed
about the room, their wooden sides clawed and shattered.
The house belonged to a jester named Katas Polk who was a vicious
killer when he wasn’t entertaining people in the bazaar. He lured travelers
back to this house, and killed them as they wandered among his many
collections. Katas dumped the bodies into a sinkhole behind the house.
Katas died accidentally when the heavy boxes of clothing fell on him
as he rummaged through his belongings. He rose three nights later as a
mohrg. The mohrg still wears Katas’ jester’s motley. Its face is painted
white and has tear streaks running down his sunken cheeks, making the
creature look like a horrific clown. The mohrg stalks visitors through the
house, trying to catch them as they search through the crates and oddities.

How Do You Like Your Eggs?

A four-foot-diameter fire pit sits in this chamber. Smoldering coals burn
brightly in the stone oven, and orange flames dance in the ash. A fivefoot-long wooden plank sits over the coals, supported on each side by red
adobe bricks. The board is barely a foot above the hot coals, and is charred
and darkened by the flames, but refuses to burn. An ovoid depression
directly over the flames is carved into the top of the plank.
Sitting on shelves around the room are various colored eggs. The eggs
are about a foot long and fit perfectly into the depression carved into the
wooden plank. There are 20 eggs total: 10 white, 2 green, 3 pink, 3 spotted
and 2 brown. Breaking the eggs does nothing. Heating them produces
effects depending on the color of the eggshell:
White: Normal ostrich eggs that pop and burst open. They can be eaten
and are quite delicious.
Green: A smelly gas rises into the air and lingers for 1d4+3 rounds. The
gas smells like rotten eggs and makes anyone who fails a saving throw
violently ill for 1d4 hours.
Pink: A sweet-smelling scent is emitted as the egg burns. The egg
dissolves into a puddle within the wooden depression in 1d6 rounds. If the
salve is applied to burns or injuries, it heals 1d6+1 points of damage. The
pink salve can be collected and stored for a month. There is enough for
two applications per egg.
Spotted: These eggs burst in an explosion of fireworks similar to a
pyrotechnics spell.

Gas Bags

Twelve, three-foot-diameter bags of gas-filled flesh float like pale
balloons through this 50-foot-by-50-foot underground cavern. Many
have faces, hair, tattoos and even jewelry attached to their bloated forms.
Skinned bodies lie on the floor below the floating horrors. Small tubes
jutting from the walls have spiked silver nozzles on their ends. A wooden
table contains spindles of thread, large needles jammed into the wood, and
a paste-like glue.
The gas bags are the creation of a wicked annis named Druella Ga.
She skins her victims, then sews up their flesh. She uses the silver nozzles
to inflate the flesh bags with naturally occurring helium. She is unaware
that the helium source is tainted with yellow mold spores. Each gas bag is
filled with yellow mold that grows inside the drifting balloons. Prodding
the dried skin has a 1 in 4 chance of causing a flesh bag to burst apart,
spraying yellow mold throughout the chamber.

A bulbous body twelve feet in diameter, resting atop tiny legs, a
monstrous mouth is almost entirely a huge, gaping maw equipped with
rows upon rows of sharp, pointed teeth. Atop the strange creature’s body,
two short eye-stalks allow it to see its prey, even in total darkness. Each
of these eye-stalks can discharge a sleep ray, causing potential prey to fall
into a deep slumber; this requires a successful attack roll by the monstrous
mouth, but no saving throw is permitted. The slumber is identical to
that caused by a magic-user’s sleep spell, but affects creatures with any
number of hit dice. Each eye-stalk can use a sleep ray only once per day.
Another, even stranger, ability is the monstrous mouth’s capacity to
inhale with such force that a specific target up to 30ft away may be sucked
into the creature’s toothy maw. A successful attack roll by the monstrous
mouth, followed by a failed saving throw on the part of the victim, will
result in the victim being “sucked” into the creature’s mouth. Once the
victim is sucked in, the monstrous mouth constricts its interior to pin the
victim, suffocating him in 1d4+2 rounds. A successful saving throw is
required to escape. Each round spent trapped within a monstrous mouth
will inflict damage equal to 1d6, +1hp if the victim is wearing leather
armor, +2 if the victim is wearing metal armor other than plate mail, and
+3 if the victim is wearing plate mail.

Wind Tunnels

Howling, hurricane-like winds roar through this narrow cave opening.
The sucking air current creates a banshee-like wail as air whooshes
into the cleft between two granite stones marking the cave mouth. The
passage slopes downward for 500 feet before splitting into five varioussized tunnels that head deeper into the earth. The floor is smooth, slick
stone. The wind is erratic and comes from random directions and tunnel
openings.
The wind is caused by a monstrous mouth trapped in the lower caverns.
The mouth can’t climb up the slick stone to get to the surface. When the
mouth inhales, the air pulls victims toward its maw, requiring a saving
throw to keep from sliding down one of the tunnels because of the slick
stone floors. The monstrous mouth cannot climb the sloping passages.
The bodies of past victims are strewn throughout the lower cavern. PCs
searching the lower tunnels find 274 gp, a collection of ivory chess pieces
(150 gp for a complete set) and a silver horseshoe (25 gp).

Feathery and brightly fluttering, the mothdog is, as its name suggests,
a magical crossbreed of moth and dog. The head has compound eyes
and feelers; otherwise the creature looks like a greenish-feathered dog.
Mothdogs can be tamed, due to their canine intelligence. However, these
creatures are insects that lay eggs and undergo a larval stage. A mothdog
can emit a piercing high-pitched sound, primarily as a warning signal;
if maintained for more than one round, it may cause disorientation and
temporary deafness to all within a radius of 5ft per mothdog in the group.
Some forest folk, particularly nocturnal humanoids, use mothdogs as
guard dogs. The combination of canine scent and bat-like echolocation
makes the mothdog a superb tracker; some wilderness villages have been
known to employ them as tracking beasts.

The field is home to 10 mothdogs that roll through the highly

wild eyed and erratic, snapping at butterflies and chasing their tails in
tight circles through the air. The mothdogs growl and bare their teeth at
anyone picking the aromatic flowers. The dogs have a 2 in 6 chance of
attacking strangers who approach them. The strong scent clouds their

Little is known about these eerie and malevolent beings. Their
appearance in a civilized area is cause for fear and alarm, for they kill
humans, sometimes stalking a particular individual, sometimes haunting
a specific location such as a crossroads in search of victims. Mothmeres
are humanoid in shape, but with great, membranous wings, dark blue-grey
skin, and eyes that glow with a faint reddish hue. They have no arms. A
mothmere is generally seven feet or so in height, but can be as large as
ten feet tall. Mothmeres are most commonly found in the ethereal plane,
which may be their natural habitat. They can move into the ethereal plane
once per round, becoming immune to any material damage and to all
spells other than those with a mental effect. Mothmeres frequently use this
ability to enter closed rooms and dismember the inhabitants. A mothmere’s
faintly glowing eyes cause fear within 30ft, causing any creature of fewer
than 4HD to make a saving throw or flee for 3d12 rounds. Mothmeres
can carry 300 lbs. weight while flying, and often pick their victims up to
drop from great heights. They also have the ability to control fire at will,
as per the pyrotechnics spell. It is unknown why these creatures attack
(never eating their prey) or why they seem to haunt areas for periods of
time and then suddenly leave. Some claim to have been haunted by these
creatures for weeks before being found dead or simply never seen again.
Mothmeres typically make temporary lairs in old ruined buildings, hidden
caves or mines, or in trees, using them as places to rest during the day and
to store trophies from their kills.

Like a Moth to a Flame

A burned brass lantern hangs from a low tree branch. The magical
lantern always remains filled with clear oil, no matter how long it burns.
The wick similarly never burns away. The outer surfaces of the lamp are
blackened, as if it was pulled from a roaring blaze, but it works just fine.
The lantern was cursed long ago by the witch Granny Hazela when it set
her tree house abattoir ablaze. The lamp casts a soft yellow glow in a 60foot radius around the person holding it when it is lit. It has a 20% chance
of attracting a mothmere to it the first day it is lit. This chance goes up 5%
each day thereafter it is used until one of the creatures appears. The chance
drops to 20% after that and rises as described. The mothmere attacks the
wielder. The lantern also has a 1% chance any time it is lit of exploding
in a fiery explosion that does 6d6 points of damage to anyone within a 30
foot radius (as the witch found out).

sconces on the wall flicker feebly in the passageway. Creosote darkens the

other vermin cling tenaciously to the shredded cloth. Anyone touching the
bandages must make a saving throw or be afflicted by a rotting disease.
The room beyond is filled with a three-foot-deep layer of sawdust
and powdered natron. Clay jars sit on niches along the walls. A stone
embalmer’s table with a human-body shaped depression is surrounded by
the powder. Hooks and other metal implements sit on the table. Six fresh
corpses lie partially buried around the table. All of the bodies are slashed
and gutted, their insides spilling across the sawdust-covered floor.
Covered by the sawdust and natron are 2 unwrapped mummies. Each
unfinished mummy has various metal hooks jammed into its hands and

Soft Men

Vines wrap tightly around eight humanoid forms hanging from the
rocky ceiling of this wide tunnel leading upward to the Mushroom Grotto,
an underground greenhouse of fungi. The bodies hang upside down, their
heads swinging just a couple of feet above the stone floor. The vines
tighten noticeably like snakes around their charges, causing the bodies to
swing and shift. A few of the peoples’ heads stick out of the vines. Their
mouths gape, and mushrooms grow from their throats. Moss covers their
open, unblinking eyes.
The vines are 8 strangle vines growing from the roof of the tunnel.
The vines ignore PCs unless they unwrap or dislodge the victims. Of the
eight bodies, two still live, but just barely. Hannid Everwrought is an elf
maiden who stopped to smell a pretty flower near the Grotto. The other
is a dwarf prospector named Fuglish Ashenchisel who was mining in the

Nagas

“Naga” is the Sanskrit word for dragon or snake. In mythology, the naga are benevolent and very powerful, equivalent to Asian dragons. The nagas
portrayed here are more serpentine and less powerful; all have the body of a snake, although the head is not necessarily that of a serpent. All kinds of
interesting abilities may be found in “unusual” nagas designed by the Referee, from breathing fire to moving in and out of strange planes of existence.

The Scaled Chapel

In the serpent city of Uroborus, a massive column of rock laced with
silver veins rises out of a 30-foot-wide hole cut in a stone terrace located
beneath a massive snake sculpture. The stone pillar is 60 feet tall, rising
from a below-ground cathedral. Just the pillar’s top 15 feet rises above
ground level. The pillar is topped by a fist-sized diamond (2,000 gp) that
pulses with a red inner light.
Twelve silver manacles are attached to four stout chains that encircle
the pillar. The upper torsos of six elves hang from the manacles. Their
bodies below the waist are missing. Blood drips from the corpses into the
empty expanse beneath them and splashes into a 40-foot-diameter pool
around the base of the monstrous pillar.

The below-ground cathedral is a 100-foot-square chamber with walls
covered in gold-dragon scales. Dragon bones form a throne of sorts. A
guardian naga named Syssastalyx lives inside the cathedral and is
worshipped by the snake men of Uroborus as a goddess. They routinely

sacrifice captives and slaves to the naga to slake her blood thirst. The naga
curls up the pillar to exit the cathedral. The diamond beats to the rhythm

Hanu-nagas are a predominantly tropical and subtropical form of
naga, less magical than the human-headed variety. Rather than a humanheaded giant snake, hanu-nagas have a feral monkey head upon a great
serpentine body. These nagas lair in jungles and rainforests, haunting
forgotten temples and ancient ruins, where many are worshipped by tribes
of wild monkeys and/or apes. The most intelligent of hanu-nagas may
have followings of tribesmen or cavemen. The stylized, writhing dance
of a hanu-naga allows it to exert a mystic control over apes and monkeys
within a radius of 300ft. These controlled creatures will act at the naga’s
mental command. It is not necessary for the apes to actually see the
naga’s dance to fall under its control; indeed, when a hanu-naga begins its
dance, simian creatures within one mile (to a maximum of 20 apes) will
immediately begin moving at top speed to the dancing naga’s presence.
The naga may dance and attack at the same time. The bite of a hanu-naga
is poisonous, and if the naga hits with its constricting attack it will inflict
automatic damage of 1d6 per round until killed.

The Well-Pit of the Monkey God

Dozens of monkeys sit atop six-foot-tall basalt walls nearly concealed
by vines snaking throughout the Seething Jungle. Leering monkey skulls
are carved into the tops of the stone barriers. Seven walls rise along the
hillside, each about 15 feet farther up the hill than the last. Monkeys sit
on the walls, facing outward as if watching the jungle. Their stares are
unnerving and direct, and they turn in unison to follow intruders. They
make no move to stop people climbing over the walls to the summit,
however.
At the top of the hill, a 30-foot-deep stone-lined well descends into the
earth. Stones pushed into the wall provide handholds to easily descend the
shaft. Monkey skulls sit on many of the handholds and fall with a clatter
to the floor below if knocked free. The underground chamber contains
hundreds of monkey skeletons. A crude bone-and-vine monkey idol sits
atop the broken bones. A tunnel leads into the darkness.
A hanu-naga named Tetza’canital sleeps in the darkness of the cave,
but rises to attack anyone entering its lair. The hanu-naga dances as it
uncurls from its bed. The dance draws 40 monkeys who sit on the walls
outside. They scramble down into the pit to attack intruders. In the cave is

a +1 long sword with a monkey head engraved in its pommel, 600 gp, an
uncut ruby (400 gp), a bronze monkey mask set with emeralds (250 gp)
and a silver mirror (30 gp).

The Serpent Gems

A golden circlet studded with green emeralds (1,500 gp) sits on a marble
bust of a hawk-nosed man in this dark top room atop the Witch’s Loft.
The abandoned tower stands on a red shale rock promontory deep in the
Kanderi Desert where the desert sands bloom in grit-filled geysers. Thick
velvet curtains hang from the stone walls of the octagonal chamber. The
drapes flutter in the light breezes blowing through the chamber through
high iron windows open to the elements. A fine layer of white sand covers
the floor.
The circlet is a work of art, with two gold strands twisting around
each other. Taking it off the bust releases a spirit naga named Ailyoustis
Canebreak trapped for 500 years in the emeralds. The creature appears in
a chamber at the base of the tower and winds her way upward toward the
PCs and the circlet. A magic-user trapped the naga in the serpent gems to
power a massive iron cobra. Anyone putting on the circlet receives visions
of a metal snake body buried under tons of sand. The circlet causes a severe
headache in the wearer whenever he faces the direction of the trapped iron
cobra. The headache does 1 point of damage per day it is worn.

Water nagas might be of any alignment. They do not ordinarily have
human heads, but like the guardian nagas they will have some physical
attributes separating them clearly from normal serpents. In the case
of water nagas, this might be the color of the scales or the presence of
flowing beard-like fins, perhaps. Water nagas are from 10 to 15ft long.
Water nagas cast magic-user spells (4/2/1). A sample spell selection for a
water naga might be: level 1: charm person x2, magic missile, sleep; level
2: mirror image, web; level 3: protection from normal missiles.

The Whirlpool’s Protector

A torrential whirlpool spins rapidly in the middle of the Seris River
rushing between the Krait Cliffs. The surging water whips the steep walls,
carving its way into the rock to create massive slabs that overhang the
circling waters. The whirlpool’s funnel twists and spins like a tornado
trapped underwater. Floating in the spray above the funnel opening is a
glowing blue orb in which a large diamond (2,500 gp) spins at the same
speed as the waters below. The gem stays just a few feet above the spray
at all times, but moves side to side as the mouth of the whirlpool shifts.
The whirlpool is home to a water naga that lives in a cliffside cave
beneath the waterline. The water naga is extremely possessive of the
whirlpool and the gem that generates it. It rises from the water to attack
anyone bothering the gem. The naga has the head of a lion, with a mane
of green river weeds. A wand that lowers water (4 charges left) is jammed
into a crevice inside the naga’s underwater cave.

A Nemorphis is a non-corporeal entity that absorbs stray memories and
thoughts; they are sometimes attracted toward the sudden reassemblance
of memories that takes place when a person is raised from the dead. Once
a Nemorphis forms a psychic link to its victim (saving throw negates), it
drains an experience level per day, using absorbed memories and feelings
to become a ghostly duplicate of its victim, a so-called Nemorphic Twin.
During the days when the victim is being drained of life energy, he
frequently becomes lost in wistful reveries of past times, alternating with
vivid nightmares.
Once the victim descends to 1st Level, the Twin becomes corporeal,
usually resembling a more youthful version of the victim. The Nemorphic
Twin will track the person down the next day and attempt to slay him,
having the same stats, skills and spells possessed by the weakened twin.
Whichever combatant is victorious “inherits” the drained experience
levels, in a rush of sensations that has a 1 in 4 chance of sending the victor
into a coma lasting 1d6 hours. If defeated, a Nemorphic Twin disappears,
leaving no trace of its short existence. If the Nemorphic Twin wins, it
will be drawn to the places and people it “remembers.” People interacting
with the Nemorphic Twin will find it “wrong” in many ways, for it is still
mentally inhuman, whatever its guise.

Birds of a Feather

Two large mirrors on opposite walls of this ornate chamber reflect
a gilded metal cage standing in the center of the room. The cage is big
enough to hold a human if they sit on the small wooden stool placed inside.
Angelic figures are fashioned into the cage’s gold strands, as are flowers,
birds and clouds. Astute PCs may spot that each figure has exactly one
twin precisely opposite it on the cage. The door to the cage is closed and
latched, but opens easily.
If anyone enters the cage and sits on the stool, a confusion spell
is triggered that engulfs the entire room. The person inside the cage is
immune to the spell effect. As the spell goes off, a neomorphic twin is
also summoned into the cage with the person inside. The creature escapes
with the person in the cage, and then latches onto any PC outside the cage
who lost his memory. The creature waits until they regain their memory,
then begins usurping their identity.

Night hags come from beyond the material plane: perhaps from the
realms of dream, perhaps from the demonic pits of the underworlds.
These creatures prey upon the souls of those who are evil/chaotic: they
can cause enchanted sleep once against such individuals (saving throw,
affects up to 12th level), or visit the victim’s dreams nightly (no saving
throw) to leech away a point of constitution per night until the attribute
reaches 0 and the hag can steal away the soul. In combat, night hags
can magically weaken an opponent to half normal strength (saving throw)
three times per day; additionally, they can use a spell that automatically
inflicts 2d8 points of damage against a single opponent. Both of these
abilities have a range of 100ft. A hag can also also become ethereal and
incorporeal at will, summon a demon ally once per day (with only a 50%
chance of success), and cannot be hit by weapons with a magical bonus of
+2 or less. They are highly resistant to magic, as well.

Corpse Lights

A twisted redwood deep in the Tanglewood Forest is gnarled and
misshapen, its trunk bent over like an old man slouching forward. Its
limbs scrape the ground, digging furrows in the dirt when the wind
stirs them. Human and animal skulls hang from the branches on vines
woven through the eye sockets. Hundreds of jawbones are driven into
the redwood’s trunk to form a ladder of handholds rising into the upper
reaches of the ancient tree.
The tree is the home of Harig Kwaad, a night hag. She lives in a
small hut sitting on a bent trunk nearly 70 feet in the air. The hag’s hut is
decorated with animal skins and has a peaked roof of sharpened femurs.
The hideous hag has coarse black hair that hangs down around her long,
angular face. The skulls of rodents are woven into her black mane. Several
corpses cocooned in black hair hang off the trunk beneath her home. She
routinely lights them on fire to enjoy the stench of burning flesh. PCs in
the forest may see the burning fire flickering in the treetops. Flies and bats
swarm around the fiery corpses, some occasionally coming too close and
catching fire.

The Nightmare Carriage

The night hag Harig Kwaad is a fickle creature whose presence
drains the life from the forest around her home high in a bent and twisted
redwood. When the life is sapped from the forest, the night hag transforms
the massive redwood into a wooden carriage with a hellish phrase known
only to her. As the redwood shrinks and transforms into the thorn-covered
carriage, 4 nightmares also appear to pull the horrible carriage. Two
skeletons rise from the many bones entangled in the tree to serve as a
driver and coachman.
The nightmares line up in front of the carriage as living vines snake
out to serve as harnesses. The animals serve Harig without question, and
attack at her bidding.

The Water Cult

A group of 16 people — 10 men and six women — stands waist deep
in the cool waters of a pond deep in the forest. Their clothing is drenched
and their faces are blank. Their hair hangs in limp strands about their
slack, doughy faces. White water lilies decorate their hair. Each person
holds his hands out before him, allowing fat frogs to squirm and leap
from them into the water. The banks of the pond are littered with rusted
weapons, inedible rations and rotted parchments. The remnants of a firepit
are evident. The skeleton of a pig on a spit sits above the rotted logs.
Living in the pond are 3 nixies. Two of the fey control five of the people,
and one controls six. The people in the water are adventurers who camped
beside the pond nearly nine months ago. The nixies took offense to the
light, laughter and the adventurers’ cursing. When the men slaughtered a
wild boar, the angry nixies coaxed the men and women one by one into
the water to serve them and the forest they had defiled. PCs that harm the
forest or bother the entranced individuals face the same fate. The nixies
plan to release their victims after one year serving the forest around them.

An armor-plated giant crashes through the village gates, swinging a
giant club embedded with metal rivets wildly at any creature stupid enough
to get in its way. Scrambling around its feet are 8 giant rats that leap
atop those knocked to the ground by the angry giant. The smell wafting
off the giant is nauseating, like a dead creature left too long in the hot
sun. Anyone looking closely sees that the armor the creature wears is not
linked together, but actually sewn into its skin. The monster clanks and
creaks as it moves, the plates rubbing and rasping together like continents
crashing into one another.
The nykoul Gergasi Kemation stomps through the village, smashing
things as he walks. The plates make him tougher to hit (giving him AC
2[17]), but cause his spells to fail 20% of the time. A group of malevolent
pixies tortured the creature by grafting plates of armor to its skin after it

Down on the Farm

Orchids, roses and lilies cover the grounds of this pleasant farm set deep
in the Fontus Valley. Vines grow greedily over the farmhouse, appearing
ready to pull the structure back into the ground if they were given the
chance. Pigs run wild through the lush fields. The home is empty and
has been for nearly a year. Dust coats the belongings left behind. A pond
of crystal blue water sits in the center of the farmstead. A young woman
swims naked in the pond, lounging amid the abundant water lilies.
A woman is a nymph named Selmago Grell. The pigs running free
on the farm are all men who looked on the beautiful creature and were
transformed into swine. Selmago dislikes weapons of any sort and tosses
them into the pond after she deals with their owners. The bottom of the
pond is covered in rusting weapons, farm implements (Selmago has a
loose definition of weaponry) and even knives and forks. Anyone diving
to the bottom of the 20-foot-deep pond has a 10% chance of finding a
minor magical weapon amid the rusting clutter. The chance decreases by
1% for each additional attempt (to a 1% chance) as swimming PCs stir up

An oblivion wraith appears very much like a wraith, and shares the same
immunity to non-magic weapons and cold, but it is not actually undead,
being a creature of the void rather than undeath. An oblivion wraith’s
touch shreds the raw existence of the creature hit, dealing 3d6 points of
damage and also permanently draining one point from the target’s highest
attribute for every natural 5 or 6 rolled on the damage dice. For example,
a damage roll of 6, 3, and 5 on 3d6 deals 14 damage and drains 2 points
from the target’s highest attribute. In addition, if a creature brings any
nonliving object (such as a swung weapon) into contact with an oblivion
wraith, the object is irrevocably disintegrated (magical objects receive a
saving throw). Oddly, oblivion wraiths are unable to actively disintegrate
objects by touching them.

Eye of the Beholder

Snowflake-sized particles of ash drift about this gallery of hanging
portraits and marble sculptures. Most of the artwork is mundane, depicting
aristocrats posing with dead animals or beautiful ladies sitting on coral
benches. One disturbing painting stands out among the others, however.
The painting’s canvas is slathered with an ugly mix of blacks and ochers
to create a nauseating splash of anger inside the frame. The four-foot-bysix-foot frame is made of linked leg bones polished to a gleaming white.
The painting is a portal into oblivion created by a deranged magic-user
who paid the ultimate price after he made a pact with a demonic princess.
His femurs now make up parts of the frame. The painting is mesmerizing,
but staring into it activates the portal. Anyone who looks into the portrait
must make a saving throw or stand fixated as he tries to make sense of the
distorted shapes caught on canvas. An oblivion wraith trapped within the
painting arrives within 1d4+1 rounds to collect the art lover.

A four-poster bed with a lace canopy draped over it stands in this empty

unused for decades. The coverlets on the bed are faded and moldy, and
moths have eaten holes in the lace canopy. The mattress has settled into
the wooden bedframe. An iron vanity stands against the wall. Matching
silver combs and a mirror (100 gp) sit on its green glass top. Dust coats
everything in a thick layer. Feathers lie atop the dust, spread across the
floor from a rip torn in the down-filled mattress. The mattress is still solid,
but sort of spongy to the touch.
An ochre jelly crawled under the room’s locked door and into the
mattress through the rip torn in its side. The ooze’s acidic surface ate away
at the insides of the mattress, but an outer lining lets the mattress keep its
shape. While it appears to be a normal mattress, anyone climbing onto

Tentacles and Tridents

A 15-foot-wide gray stone pier extends nearly a quarter mile into the
Reaping Sea. The rocks are slick with saltwater washing over the edifice
from powerful breakers crashing into the wall. The cobblestone walkway
atop the pier is 10 feet above the surface of the sea. During storms, waves
easily rise above the walkway, threatening to sweep away anyone walking
along the treacherous surface. A 10-foot-tall portico covers the last 50 feet
of the pier. Marble pillars spaced every 10 feet hold up a peaked roof. The
walkway ends in a 30-foot-diameter gazebo-like structure built at the end
of the pier.
A statue of a nude woman stands on a conch shell in the center of the
gazebo. Dried seaweed wraps around her body, and live crabs scuttle
around her feet. She holds a trident leveled toward the open sea. More
tridents line the walls of the temple, each fastened to a stone pillar with
silver clamps. Cool, fresh water pours from the conch shell to pool in a
basin around the statue of Xeto, the beautiful goddess of sea monsters.
The temple is protected by 2 giant octopuses that pull themselves out of
the ocean using the pillars around the temple dedicated to their goddess.

gaze of an oculaktis actually transmits a powerful beam that can cause
magnificent explosions, incinerate solid stone, or melt men to puddles of
steaming jelly. The heat beam has a range of 100ft and the first time it is
used it inflicts 6d6 points of damage (saving throw for half damage) to its

the beam only inflicts 3d6 points of damage (save for half). The oculaktis

The Insane Eye

A crystal ball sits on a golden stand decorated by hundreds of carved
eyes. Scintillating colors weave and twist inside the orb. If anyone touches
the ball, the colors vanish, replaced by an unblinking eyeball that fills the
sphere. The PC touching the globe must make a saving throw or be drawn
into the globe. The PC can voluntarily fail the save, if desired. His body
vanishes as if winking out of existence.
The PC pulled into the globe finds himself standing atop a gigantic
eyeball drifting through a void of flashing colors. The colors each have
unique smells. The eyeball is an oculaktis drifting randomly around the
void. The eyeball occasionally approaches bright points of white light
hovering in the colors. Touching a point of light draws the PC back into
the real world through another crystal ball. The GM is free to get creative
with these destinations.
The eyeball is a transport system the owner of the globe used to get
around the world. Up to 10 people can use the crystal ball to arrive on the
same oculaktis. However, there is a 10% chance per person (10% chance
for one person, 40% chance for four, etc.) that their presence drives the
eyeball insane and causes it to attack its riders. Anyone falling off the
oculaktis drifts aimlessly in the color-filled void. A PC must make a

Whack That Mole

A raucous din rises from beyond a stand of beech trees. Heavy thuds
of a club smacking the growl are followed by animal-like growls and
grunts. Deep-throated laughter follows each hit. PCs who investigate
the sounds find a bizarre sight: Hundreds of iron spikes are driven into
the ground, forming a crude 50-foot-diameter circle around the clearing.
The area inside the circle is crisscrossed by raised trails of dirt. An ogre
stands inside the spikes, repeatedly slamming a heavy wooden club
into the ground. Dirt clods fly high into the air as the ogre pummels the
ground. The ogre growls angrily after each hit, and stomps the ground in
frustration.
Sitting on the ground outside the iron spike ring are 3 ogres. Each one
laughs uproariously as the ogre with the club tromps across the clearing.
The ogres take turns smashing the club into the ground. The ogres trapped
a mole that kept them awake last night, and are trying to beat it to death.
The cagey animal weaves across the clearing, trapped by the spikes. The
mole can escape whenever it wants, but seems to be playing with the dimwitted ogres. The ogres grab their clubs and attack anyone interrupting
their game.

Swamp Ogres are larger, semi-aquatic cousins of standard ogres. They
range in color from moldy green to burnt yellowish-brown, and they
have huge heads that protrude forward from their enormous, hunched
shoulders. Their great arms are able to rotate around completely, allowing
them to easily reach anywhere on their backs and shoulders. Swamp
Ogres are often covered in moss, swamp grass, and mud, which facilitates
their favorite mode of Attacks: Surprise. Swamp Ogres sit or lie down
in the muck (depending on depth) so that just their great shoulder hump
protrudes above the mire; when still, they need to breathe only once
each hour. While in this position, a Swamp Ogre waits until someone or
something sets foot upon its shoulders, whereupon its arms move with
lightning speed to grab its victim and pull it down into the mire to be eaten.
If the Swamp Ogre hits with both hands, it drags the opponent completely
below the mire to drown in 4-6 rounds. If the Swamp Ogre hits with only
one hand, it drags the opponent under on the following round, unless 8
points of damage is dealt to its hand or it is otherwise forced it to loosen its
grip. Once its opponent is underneath the mire, the Swamp Ogre uses its
conventional claw and bite attacks on the unfortunate victim. If a Swamp
Ogre scores a natural 20 with its bite attack against a man-size or smaller
opponent, it swallows that opponent whole. A swallowed opponent suffers
1d8 damage each round from stomach acid, can’t attack with anything
larger than a dagger, and ultimately suffocates in 2d4 rounds. Author:

Stay on the Path

A line of slick, flat black stones jut out of the murky waters of the Sin
Mire Swamp. The path leads into the center of a thick morass of reeds,
red-striped weeds and stagnant water. A twisted banyan tree grows out of
the center of the mire at the end of the stone path. Its branches dip into the
murky waters around it. Algae cling to its bark, rising up along the trunk
in greenish swirls. Moss drapes from the tree’s branches, and swamp rats
run easily along its broad limbs. A hollow opening in the trunk contains
a gleaming gem sitting among a handful of acorns. The gem sparkles in
the sunlight.
One of the stones along the path is a swamp ogre crouching in the
six-foot-deep water. The hungry monster waits for someone to step on its
back before grabbing them and holding them underwater. The “gem” is a
polished rock the ogre placed in the tree to lure victims. The body of an
decomposing elf lies underwater near where the ogre crouches. The elf
is dressed in chainmail that weighs the corpse down. A pouch attached
to the ogre’s belt contains 147 gp, a waterlogged and unreadable journal,
and a gold ring (300 gp) engraved with the words “To My Love. Return
Always to Me.”

Tusken ogres are a race of ogres mid-way between the normal, feral
ogre and the magically potent ogre mage. These ogres have a only a pale
bluish tint to their skin, and powerful tusks protruding from their mouths.
They are somewhat more intelligent than normal ogres, and are often
found in the service of an ogre mage. Tusken ogres that are not minions of
an ogre mage, encountered in the wild, often inhabit crude but human-like
residences. They dress in silk garments taken from victims or merchants,
and usually fight with polearms or outsized swords. They are inveterate
slavers, and their lairs will often contain human prisoners, especially
women. A tusken ogre has one magical ability, which is to create a single
mirror image of itself at the beginning of a battle. As with the spell mirror
image, the illusory double will disappear when it is hit. Female tusken
ogres are encountered only rarely. Asian and European varieties of the
tusken ogre are actually quite similar, although the European type would
likely not be dressed in silk but in whatever finery might be available.

Tusken Slaver

A large silk tent sits on the desert sands, colorful pennants flying from
poles holding the canvas up. A four-foot-tall statue of an elephant sits
in front of the tent’s entrance flap. Cool water jets into the air from the
statue’s upraised trunk. The sand around the statue is saturated with the
ever-flowing water. A woman wearing silk veils and loose-fitting clothing
sits on a red cushion located just inside the tent. She has dark hair and
eyes, and her skin is extremely pale. She welcomes visitors and bids them
sit on plush cushions thrown around the tent’s interior. She offers plump
grapes and fresh water to her guests. She claims she is the lost queen of
the burning wastes.
The food and water are poisoned with a sleep-inducing agent derived
from the venom of a desert scorpion. Anyone eating or drinking the food
offered by the woman must make a saving throw or fall asleep for 1d4+2
hours. The tent is the desert home of a tusken ogre named Allatin alSalk. The slaver is always looking to add to his collection of slaves. The
woman is a loyal companion who sold out her nomadic companions when
the ogre attacked. Her friends are chained inside an enclosure buried
under the hot sands behind the tent. Inside the slave pen are 4 men and 3
women. All are dehydrated and delirious. The ogre holds slave auctions
once a month to sell slaves he captures.

The ogre mage is an ogre with magic powers, based on Japanese legend.
An ogre mage can fly, turn invisible (per the spell), create a
10-foot-radius circle of magical darkness, change into human form,
cast Sleep and Charm Person once per day, and cast a Cone of Frost
with a range of 60 feet to a base of 30 feet, causing 8d6 damage to any
caught within (saving throw applies). Western folklore also contains many
examples of shape-shifting, magical ogres (the most famous example being
the one in Puss-in-Boots), so there might be many different interpretations
of magical ogres whether or not they are called“ogre mage.”

Coin Collector

A single gold coin dangles on a silver chain from an oaken crossbeam
supporting the roof of a gazebo-like temple standing amid a garden of
hyacinths. Four elaborate columns covered with gold leaf hold up the
wooden roof. The temple’s ceiling is painted with murals of a dragon
wrapping around the world, its flaming breath burning the moon and
stars into oblivion. The coin is ancient, with the marks of the forgotten
kingdom of Kor-Tokeen. One side has a tipping scale, while the other
shows a glowing sun rising above a feather.
Anyone taking the gold coin does so at their peril. The coin contains the
spirit of an ogre mage trapped for nearly 200 years. Removing the coin
from the temple allows the ogre mage to reform in 1d4 days within 10
feet of the bearer of the coin. The ogre mage viciously attacks, mistakenly
thinking the person with the coin is the person who originally trapped him.

Oktomon appear rather like man-sized octopi, but they are actually clever
tool and weapon-using “humanoids.” They generally live underwater,
either fresh or salt, but are fully amphibious and can breathe on land as
well as underwater. Oktomon walk on 4 of their eight legs and use the other
4 as arms. In combat, Oktomon use various combinations of four weapons
and shields. They do not typically use pulled bows, but may occasionally
make use of crossbows. Due to their wide-set eyes and multiple arms, it
is virtually impossible to flank an Oktomon or successfully attack one
“from behind.” Oktomon are attracted to shiny objects and often carry a
number of items of jewelry with them as prized possessions. Oktomon are
renowned for their mechanical abilities, and an Oktomon lair is typically
a very dangerously trapped location. Tales of magic-using Oktomon are
often told, but have yet to be verified. Depending on the source, it is also
reported that Oktomon are either outright hostile towards or firmly allied
with Sea Hags. It is possible, of course, that different groups of Oktomon
may have different allegiances.

The Sea Hag’s Entourage

The Coral Castle of Cnidaria rises off the seabed nearly a quarter-mile
off Bargarsport’s coastline. Delicate coral spires rise above the rolling
waves high above the structure. Impaled on these sharp protrusions are
dolphins, a mermaid, and various colorful fish. A great white shark
swims nimbly through the spires, watching for prey. Occasionally, it tears
chunks off the hanging corpses. Blood fills the water in dark clouds. The
great white has three diamond studs (75 gp each) driven through its dorsal
fin.
The castle is an underwater architectural wonder, with arched
doorways, sprawling rooms, flying buttresses and floors of smooth pearl.
Inside the throne room where giant clams hold the pearl treasures of the
undersea kingdom, the sea hag Scombrotix Caryon lounges on a throne
created from the upper jaws of hundreds of swordfish. She is served by 10
oktomon and 15 sahuagin.

An “old crawler” is a withered human hand severed at the wrist, black
and mummified in appearance. Many think they may originate from the
leftovers of a lich. Old crawlers attack by sneaking up on a character and
grabbing his or her foot; or they drop from a higher place onto the head,
face or shoulder of the poor adventurer. The grip of an old crawler can
only be broken with a roll of 1 on a d4 (1-2 if the character has magical
or special strength). Any area squeezed by an old crawler is subject to
gangrenous rotting, and continues to incur damage until the grip is broken.
Once latched on, the old crawler remains so until destroyed or pried loose.
Some old crawlers have magical rings that can still cast attacks. While
fire would be the most obvious harm to the hand, it poses quite a threat
if attached to a victim. Bashing attacks are the most effective. The old
crawler can “flee” with a scrambling move when needed at double its
normal crawling rate. Note that Old crawlers are extremely resistant to
many attacks due to magically improved saving throws left over from
their strange origins (included in stats).

Cool Hand Fluke

A dolphin flies through the waves, leaping from one ocean swell to the
next in a dazzling display of agility. The creature hones in on the shore,
however, and its headlong flight sends it skidding and tumbling to a stop at
PCs’ feet on the sandy beach. At a distance, the dolphin was spectacular;
close up, it is horrifying. The dolphin’s skin is mottled and cankerous,
with rotting flesh sloughing down its cadaverous sides. A decayed hand is
latched onto the dolphin’s tail fluke, the cool fingers grasping firmly into
its flesh. Purple welts rise on the fluke under the fingers’ pressure.
The hand is an old crawler that leaped into the Reaping Sea to escape
the pirate ship Red Wolf after the hand strangled the crew and started an
oil fire that consumed the ship. The hand latched onto a passing dolphin,
and the panicked creature finally brought it to shore. The old crawler
attacks anyone investigating the dying dolphin.

Omgoths were once holy men who, through betrayal of their faith, now
suffer from a curse that has given them a rotting, ghoulish appearance.
Indeed, they look so much like ghouls that they are often mistaken for one.
Their bodies are in always in a continuous state of decay and they must
regularly feed on the living to replenish their lost flesh or the curse will
consume them. Omgoths exude an aura of corruption that causes healing
magics employed in their presence to damage the intended recipient
instead of healing; be they from spells, potions or magical items. Though
omgoths may be found in the company of undead creatures, they are not
themselves undead and cannot be turned.

The Unholy Men of Mon-Serreat

A staircase at the top of the Mon-Serreat Cliffs leads downward along
the sheer cliff face to a 20-foot-tall recess carved into the rack wall.
Carved half-pillars stand on either side of double doors leading into the
rock wall to Absence Monastery. Inside the monastery’s dark halls, the
smell of decay and death rises thickly through the stifling air. Clouds
of buzzing flies and biting insects swarm through the stone corridors.
A circular central chamber contains a number of wooden pews facing a
2-foot-diameter golden font filled with cool, clear water. Words engraved
in the stone floor around the font read “The Health of the World, Flowing
from the Mon-Serreat Stones, Drink and be Fulfilled.”
The waters once healed all who drank of them. The monastery was
taken over years ago by 10 omgoths that currently live in the ossuary
accessed by steep, unlit stairs that descend into the crypts. The presence of
the unholy omgoths corrupted the healing waters, so that anyone drinking
the liquid takes 2d4+2 points of damage with each sip (save for half).
The waters return to normal a few weeks after the omgoths are destroyed.
Once restored, the waters heal 1d6+4 points of damage three times per day
for a drinker. The water can be stored and carried for up to a month, after
which it turns into golden flakes that can be spread on wounds to heal 1d4
points of damage.

Breeding Ground

This dank, lightless cellar beneath the dry wastes of the Kanderi Desert
stinks of human waste and rotting food. The cellar is barely visible in the
desert, and layers of sand hide its presence. A flat wooden door set on the
ground may reveal its presence. The door opens into a steep staircase that
descends 15 feet below a sand dune. Chained along one cinder-block wall
in the desert cellar are four women and three men. Their hands are raised
above their heads and held in place by thick manacles driven into the
stone behind them. Their feet are free, but their awkward position against
the wall doesn’t allow them to move. Two of the men’s bodies are split
from neck to belly, the skin erupting outward in bloody ribbons. Blood
trails slither across the ground away from the gore.
The cellar is the breeding ground of 10 ophidians cast out of the
jungle city of Uroborus. The 6 lesser ophidians scour the desert with a
camel-pulled wagon to capture desert nomads. They bring the unlucky
victims back to the cellar and chain them to wall to await their fate. The
4 ophidian leaders visit the cellar at night to bite the sacrifices to spawn
a new generation of snake-men. The ophidians live under a massive rock
overhang jutting from the desert a quarter-mile to the east. The ophidians
hope to start another snake city around the rock. The new city is to be
named Pyrrhus. The snake-men attack anyone bothering the cellar.

Go, Orc, Go

The Karth Badlands contain steep rocky slopes of piled stones that rise
nearly 100 feet. The massive slabs of rock lie at all angles, like they were
cast about by giants – or something much larger and nastier. Some of the
rocks landed to form sloping stone ramps that rise to the tops of the bluffs.
Numerous broken wagons sit in the narrow canyon. Most are just piles
of rotting wood collapsing on themselves. Some are missing wheels and
others look like they smashed into the rock walls at high speeds. A few
look like they fell from great heights and smashed to the rocky ground. A
few wagons can even be spied sitting atop the bluffs, perched on the cliff
like they had stopped just short of going over.
A band of 10 orcs (all that remain out of 50) from the Chiseled Tusk
Clan use the rocky slopes to ambush travelers. The orcs pull stolen
wagons to the top of the bluffs, then push them over the side and ride them
down upon travelers. The speeding wagons careen wildly down the rocky
slopes, bouncing and jumping as they slam into dips in the rock. The orcs
ride in the open wagon, hanging on for dear life. Past attempts didn’t turn
out so well, but the orcs are persistent. PCs should be able to easily get
out of the way, and the noise the rolling wagon makes as it flies down the
slope eliminates any surprise the orcs might have had. The orcs tumble out
of the wagon to attack when the ride stops.

Paper Cuts

This 30-foot-by-40-foot room is filled waist deep with tiny strips of
sliced paper. The confetti spills out into the hallway from either oak
door when it is opened. Halflings and dwarves entering the chamber find
themselves nearly buried in the stuff. Paper lanterns filled with globes of
continual light hang from the walls. In the center of the room, a gushing
column of wind lifts the confetti from the floor and tosses it out halfway
to the 40-foot-high stone ceiling. Tiny strips float down throughout the
room like a paper snowstorm. The air column isn’t strong enough to lift
a person. At the top of the column of air, a fist-size globe of folded paper
bobbles near the ceiling.
The room is home to 10 origami warrior guardians lying flat in the
piles of torn paper. The paper-like creatures protect the folded globe,
which contains instructions for creating origami warriors. The paper globe
is folded tightly from hundreds of sheets of paper, however, and unfolding
it may rip the paper so that the process is unusable. Anyone trying to
unfold it has a 20% chance of tearing a page as they delicately open it

The ostrich races of St. Ruthio draw contestants from around the region
for the giant black pearl (200 gp) given as a prize each year. Riders mount
the ostriches in a giant holding pen, and drive birds from the pen using
leather whips. The ride is bumpy and the birds irritable. Getting the ostrich
to move in a specific direction requires leaning and making a successful
saving throw to hang on as it fights the order. Anyone who fails a save
either tumbles off the bird or it charges off in a random direction.
The birds race out of the enclosure, through the streets, and into the
trees along a route that varies each year. This year’s course runs through
the Camel Hills, where a starving pack of 6 wolves and 3 worgs wait
to give chase. The wolves work to bring down anyone riding one of the

Raw sewage drips down the sloping walls of this smelly underground

center of the room. The pit descends 50 feet into side tunnels that connect
to another area of the sewer. A mold-covered metal portcullis ripped from

a makeshift bridge to the other side of the room. Gas bubbles rise to the
surface of the sewage and pop, creating broken ripples across the ugly
surface. The entire chamber smells of feces and beer.
The sewage pit is home to an otyugh mutated by the runoff from an
aboveground dwarven bar. The amphibious creature has gills along its
sides and webbed feet that allow it to swim easily through the muck.
Otherwise, it is the same as its land-dwelling cousins. The otyugh bursts
out of the sewage to attack anyone crossing the grate. It chases PCs down

Feathered Friends

A 20-foot-tall wooden sculpture of an owl stands in this grassy
woodland. The owl has large round depressions for eyes. Two fist-sized
emeralds (300 gp each) sparkle inside the eyes. Its massive claws stab
the ground. Twigs and brush fill the bird of prey’s open beak. Chunks
of animals lie on the ground around the statue. Bloody streaks mar the
statue’s lower body.
The statue’s open beak contains a twig-and-grass nest made by a
giant owl that swoops out of the statue at night to hunt for prey in the
surrounding forest. The owl is fairly intelligent, and understands Common
but cannot speak. The owl lured an owlbear to the statue as a protector.
The owlbear sleeps in a hole dug beneath one of the claws. At the end
of its night of hunting, the giant owl always brings a meal back for the
owlbear. The owlbear responds to the owl’s screeches, thinking food has
arrived. Its lair is lined with feathers molted by the giant owl.

A birch tree stands tall in Hennis Deep, the ancient trunk surrounded by
a man-sized hedge of prickly thorns. Shiny trinkets hang among the thorns.
The items include worthless costume jewelry, real brooches, a string of

bring about 300 gp if collected from the prickly thorns. Anyone doing so

The thorn hedge contains treasures offered to the Great Horned Devil of

beast that glides on wings as silent as death. They leave the valuables
alongside chunks of raw meat so the beast passes over their homes when
it glides through the night. The true “beast” is a giant owl that cares more
for the meat than the trinkets. It casts the worthless items down from its

miners who died choking on coal dust in the dirty tunnels. These shadows
flit throughout the tunnels, causing cold winds to whisper across PCs’
necks and odd noises to sound around tight corners. Candle flames flicker
blue in their presence. The spirits are harmless manifestations that cannot
leave the mines where they once worked.
The tunnels and cross corridors are now the hunting grounds of 6
panthers. Each great cat wears a jeweled collar (120 gp). The panthers
are the mine owner’s pets. He sets them free each night to roam the mines
to keep intruders out. He fears thieves sneaking in to claim the diamond
deposits he still hasn’t found.

The Sound and the Furies

A flutter of beating wings fighting the air erupts over a low ridge as
a herd of 8 pegasi sweeps close to the rocky buttes rising toward the
sky. Mesas rise around the columns. The horses fly low, swinging back
and forth around the outcroppings. The animals hit the ground running,
charging straight for PCs. Sparks scatter as their hooves hit shale. They
halt momentarily before PCs, each lowering one wing and dipping a leg
to allow PCs to climb aboard. The horses whinny in fear and throw their
heads back to look into the air behind them.
A moment later, 2 rocs soar over the outcropping, chasing the fleeing
pegasi. The great birds slam beak-first through the stone columns, their
wings sending boulders crashing to the ground. The pegasi wait just a
moment longer before taking flight and leaving PCs to their fate with the
rocs. If PCs climb aboard, the horses do their best to evade the hungry rocs.

Strange Shadows

The bodies of eight men and women lie facedown in the thick grasses
of the Kajaani Forest, their bodies in various states of decomposition. All
are from a nearby village. Pools of blood surround the bodies, and insects
wriggle across each mutilated corpse. Some are gored, their entrails
spilling around them, while others have bite marks ripping open their
necks. All have empty ragged holes where their hearts used to be. One
of the dead women wears a cursed brooch around her neck that turns the
wearer into a wight after death. The woman’s eyes snap open and she
rises in 1d6+1 rounds to attack anyone investigating the bodies. Another
villager has a pouch containing 22 gp and a letter to his daughter.
The villagers were out gathering blueberries when they riled up a nest
of 4 perytons that swooped out of the trees and killed them. The magical
creatures descend and attack anyone disturbing their past victims. Their

Tunnel Run

The ceiling of this 100-foot-long stone corridor is lined by side-by-side
tree trunks lying horizontally 20 feet over the floor of the passageway. The
stone walls are 20 feet apart. The floor of the tunnel is sandy and pocked
by hundreds of depressions. The white sand is a couple of feet deep.
Glowing lamps sitting in recesses line the wall. The lamps are spaced
every 15 feet down the corridor. Blood mars the white sand in the center
of the passage. A skeletal arm lies in the grit.
The log ceiling is an illusion hiding the fact that the tunnel is actually
30 feet higher. Hanging on the real ceiling are 15 piercers. They are not
affected by the illusion below them, and drop onto PCs who cross through
the tunnel. Any that miss PCs hit the sand with a thud. The remains of a
halfling lie buried in the sand under the blood splotch. A pouch buried in
the sand contains a book with a hole punched through it from a piercer hit,
57 gp, a red brick, and a set of salt and pepper shakers (15 gp).

Quill Killers

A greenhouse in the Tangled Traces is a steamy paradise of tropical
plants unknown in this temperate forest. A single door leads into the
humid interior. Vines crawl up wooden trellises, and purple orchids grow
in the fertile soil. A massive beehive hangs in the building’s upper reaches.
A marble fountain gurgles in the center of the steamy room. Pinned to the
greenhouse’s wooden support beams are 6 dead nixies. Quills puncture
their bodies. Each barb is driven through the small bodies and into the
wood behind them. Another nixie lies dead on the edge of the fountain.
The dead nixie reaches for the water she’ll never touch now. A dead
porcupine lies in the damp soil.
The greenhouse is home to 9 pixies that killed the nixies that once lived
in the fountain. The evil fey live in the massive beehive, protected by 2

The Portal Camel is an intelligent and magical creature. It resembles a
normal camel, except that it has three humps and two heads. Though not
as ill-tempered as actual camels, it does have a high opinion of itself –
which it will loudly voice, being capable of speech. While a portal camel
can be used as a pack or riding animal, it will demand a higher level
of care and pay than any prospective hirelings might seek. As with its
normal kin, a portal camel is herbivorous and capable of storing water for
extended periods. They can carry 350 pounds without discomfort.
The left head of a portal camel can cast Protection from Evil and Mirror
Image each twice per day. The right head of a portal camel can cast Dispel
Magic, Haste and Slow each once per day. Three portal camels acting
together can cast Dimension Door, although they may bicker and argue
about which one will get to use it. The necks of a portal camel are snakelike in their flexibility, allowing it to turn one head back to face a rider
– perhaps to nip him on the knee.
Portal camels collect stories and legends of the lands and dimensions
through which they travel, and often become sages on obscure topics.
Their lips are almost as dextrous as human fingers, allowing them to
manipulate simple objects. They may be convinced to join an adventuring
party or merchant caravan if someone offers to act as guide and interpreter.

The Gatekeeper

A red wooden door appears in a space PCs are sure no door ever
existed. The door has a golden knob engraved with two open eyes. The
door is unlocked and opens easily. It leads into an extra-dimensional space
in a limbo-like realm where fluttering streamers form a spongy corridor
that leads off into the distance. Locked doors hover along the banner
walls, floating in the space, but all are locked from this side. The corridor
leads to a central chamber lined with more random-sized portals. A few
windows look into various regions and buildings.
A portal camel kneels on a red rug hovering in the center of this open
chamber. It smokes from a large hookah floating beside it. The camel can
take PCs any place they wish to go by leading them to specific doors and
unlocking the portals. However, a demon-wolf of Braazz now inhabits
the banner corridor between worlds, and the portal camel requires help
getting rid of the demon before it can open the correct door to send PCs

they desire, pseudo-dragons can become almost invisible (80% chance
not to be seen). They are somewhat resistant to magic (25%), and this

Sleep Induced

Four prone bodies lie on soft blankets on down mattresses in this
abandoned red barn. Three of the people are humans, and one is an elf.
Their skin is dried and sunken, and their breathing is shallow and labored.
None appears to have moved for days. Three more wooden-frame beds are
empty. Washbasins sit on the floor beside each figure, and cold cloths sit
on their clammy foreheads.
Each person lying on a bed was stung by a misguided pseudo-dragon
named Prins. The young dragon was asleep in the hay loft when the
adventurers stumbled in after a near-fatal encounter with a rampaging
chimera. One of the men said he wished he could just forget all about that
(meaning the burning of one of their friends), but the naïve pseudo-dragon
misunderstood. She thinks humans (and elves and dwarves and others as
well) want to forget all their troubles. She stung the adventurers while
they dozed.
The well-meaning pseudo-dragon now watches over them to make sure
they aren’t eaten by forest animals. She doesn’t realize they’ll soon die if
not awakened. Anyone who lies on one of the empty beds feels the sting
of the pseudo-dragon’s tail as it tries to “help” him. The dragon releases
her charges if PCs convince Prins that she is killing them.

Purple worms are massive annelids that grow 40 ft and more in length,
and sometimes exceed ten feet in width. They are subterranean, chewing
tunnels in rock (or through sand, in deserts, where they are a tan color).
These beasts swallow their prey whole on a roll 4 higher than the needed
number, or if the worm rolls double the number required to hit. They can
swallow anything the size of a horse or smaller. In addition to the worm’s
dreaded bite, it has a poison stinger on its tail, the length of a sword and
just as deadly even from the piercing wound it inflicts. In addition, the
poison injected by the stinger is lethal if the victim fails a saving throw.
What prey the purple worms once hunted with such natural weaponry
(or perhaps still do, in deep places), must have been terrifying indeed.
Aquatic versions of the purple worm might also exist.

Rock Worms

A natural dome of black rock rises out of the desert sands to a height
of nearly 50 feet at its peak. The rock grows extremely hot in the desert
sun, but the underside remains cool throughout the day. Giant troughs
of collapsed sand circle around the massive rock, as if it dropped from a
massive height and caused great ripples across the desert landscape.
The rock is home to 2 desert purple worms. The giant annelids sleep
under the massive rock during the day, and circle outward through the
cooling desert during the night as they search for food. The worms are tan
(despite their name), and extremely aggressive. They dive deep into the
sand before bursting up around creatures crossing the desert. Under the
massive rock are the skeletal remains of past kills digested by the giant
worms. Most of the skeletons are desert creatures, but a magic-user still
wearing dark robes lies among the broken bones. His finger bone still has
a gold ring of mammal control wrapped around it.

In general, quadricorns live in barren wilderness areas, and can even be

deeper subterranean catacombs.

Sitting Bull

The shadiest gambling den in Bargarsport has to be the House of
Drudge. Any vice imaginable can be found within its sleazy walls, from
gambling to prostitution. Hustlers sit at its grimy tables, and women of the
night ply their trade all day long. Ale is watered down and the wine is so
cheap it can peel paint, but patrons pay the high prices so they don’t anger
Low Gurk, the dwarven bouncer.
The House of Drudge’s most famous attraction is a stuffed bull mounted
on an elaborate pulley system in the center of the room. Anyone thinking
they can stay on the bull for a 10 seconds can put their money where their
mouth is and climb aboard. Patrons yank ropes about the room to spin
the bull and try to throw the rider to the hardwood floor. The fake bull is
covered in slick and sweaty cow hide.
A quadricorn drawn by the scent of the dead cow breaks through the
front doors to get at the house of ill repute. It charges anyone wearing red,
then attempts to escape with a matron or one of the working girls.

Quarns resemble large boulders, although they do not ordinarily grow
much larger than the size of a person. They cannot move other than an
ability to rise from or to sink into the stone where they are planted. A
quarn does have two arms, which are kept folded against the rest of the
body until the quarn attacks. If the quarn hits an opponent, the victim
must make a saving throw or begin turning into stone. This process begins
immediately with the effects of a slow spell, but the process will become
complete after 1d4+1 days, at which point the victim will become stone.
Until the process is complete, the effects can be reversed with a remove
curse or cure disease spell, but once the transformation is complete, only
a flesh to stone spell can return the victim to normal. Quarns are slow, and
will always attack last in a melee round. Because quarns are immobile,
they can cause areas to be hazardous, but colonies of them can be dashed
through or bypassed once the nature of the threat is known.

The Stone God

Carved marble columns surround an isolated temple built near the
Shadow Peaks. Large boulders stand beside a brick-lined path leading
up the rise to the temple’s copper gates. Each stone has a woman’s face
carved into it. The carved images appear to be watching the path winding
through the ash trees. Broad steps ring the circular temple and lead upward
to an open atrium under a dome ceiling. The temple’s floor is ringed with
concentric circles of black and gray tiles. Kneeling in the center of the
round room are 12 statues of men and women. The prayerful worshippers
face inward toward the temple’s empty center.
The temple is dedicated to an earth deity named Iolite. Her followers
recently discovered a wondrous boulder they planned to add to the
collection of stones leading up to the temple. They brought the boulder
into the temple to consecrate it, only to discover its true nature. The quarn
turned the kneeling worshippers to stone, then sank into the temple’s floor.
It waits until PCs investigate the statues before rising into the temple to
attack.

The Bird Man of Bargarsport

An individual wearing a motley shroud sits on a wooden bench
surrounded by a mound of coins inside a crumbling temple to a longforgotten god in the city of Bargarsport. The figure’s odd garment cloaks
him from head to foot. Insects curl and crawl across the threadbare cloth,
and feathers poke through rips in the fabric. Three armed warriors
stand at the foot of a staircase rising to the temple floor, their eyes alertly
scanning the crowd for trouble. The beleaguered people of the city keep
their distance. A young woman chained to the bench laboriously counts
the coins, even as the figure randomly tosses new money at her.
Occasionally, a sick or injured resident offers gold and a hunk of fresh
meat to one of the warriors. The petitioner is either turned away (giving
up his offering) or issued up the steps to meet the healer behind a faded
three-fold screen decorated with images of colorful parrots and other
birds. The healer is a corrupt ragged craw named Manacis Mudnester
who demands gold in exchange for helping the sick. He chews up the
offered food, and then regurgitates a portion of it into the customer’s

cupped hands. His guards are loyal as long as he pays them.
The woman is a nobleman’s daughter who was cursed by a hag to
spread disease. The ragged craw is immune to her curse, but the residents
of the cities he visits aren’t so lucky. Her presence causes leprosy, plague
and other foul diseases to spread rapidly. The ragged craw takes full
advantage of the situation to offer his healing salve. Currently, he’s made
137 gp from the scared populace as the diseases take hold. The plagues
and ailments vanish if the woman leaves town or is cured. If she is healed,
her father rewards PCs with 500 gp for returning his beloved daughter.

The Wandering Wastrel

An extremely handsome man sits on a rock in this flower-filled
meadow. He plucks long grasses growing around him and weaves them
into elaborate headpieces, necklaces and toys. A set of pan pipes hangs
from a strand of woven hair around his neck, and his colorful tunic is
adorned with freshly snipped flowers. A beagle restlessly paces the grass
around the man, sniffing the air and pawing the ground. A small serving
table sits beside the man. Dandelion wine and sassafras tea in delicate
crystal ewers sit on the table. The man invites guests to drink with him
and share stories of the road.
Shasura claims to be a traveling bard seeking fame and fortune, but
he is really an evil rakshasa seeking servants for his master, a powerful
sorcerer from the Seething Jungle. Shasura is never without his companion
Calanasi, a ferocious tiger cloaked in an illusion of the fawning beagle.
The wine and tea are, of course, drugged with a sleep agent to incapacitate
those failing a saving throw. Anyone who falls asleep wakes chained in a
slave caravan heading for the deep jungle.

Ranine are degenerate, subterranean creatures who serve the foul frogdemon Tsathoggua. Like their master, the Ranine are of broadly batrachian
appearance but possess small bat-like ears in addition to vicious fangs
and, in many cases, small horns. They are drawn to underground locations
suffused with Chaotic energies, so many also possess chaotic traits of both
the major and minor varieties.
Ranine shy away from sunlight and suffer a -1 penalty to their attack
rolls and saving throws when they operate aboveground. If given sufficient
room in combat, these creatures can hop at enemies, which gives them a
+1 bonus to attack and damage rolls. When fighting at close quarters, they
try to bite opponents in order to inject them with a paralyzing poison.
Failure to save against it results in paralysis for 3d6 turns. Ranine in
groups larger than six typically include a leader, who can cast clerical
spells as if it were a cleric of the same level as his hit dice.
Precisely how the Ranine reproduce is a mystery, as they appear to
be completely asexual. Given that these beings prefer to take opponents
prisoner rather than slay them outright, some sages have postulated that
the Ranine somehow “convert” their prey into new frog-men to swell
their ranks. If true, these creatures pose an even more terrible threat to
civilization than is commonly supposed.

carrying the scent of rendered fat and boiling blood into the winds. Jade
flames dance and flicker inside the hole. Thousands of normal frogs hop
innocently through the thick vines and heavy palms surrounding the
clearing. Their incessant croaking is deafening.
The pit is an unholy shrine to the frog god Tsathogga. Living in the
nearby jungle are 12 ranine that sacrifice people inside the pit to sate their
demonic god. Victims are dropped into the 15-foot-deep pit and allowed
to burn. The bottom of the pit contains piles of ash and brittle bones.
The jungle frogs croak to alert the aggressive ranine to intruders. The
creatures arrive within 1d6 rounds, and leap from the trees to grab potential
sacrifices. Anyone thrown into the pit takes 1d6 points of damage per
round as the green flames lick at their skin. The sides of the pit are smooth
stone, making climbing out difficult without assistance. Occasionally, a
sacrifice survives the flames and leaps from the pit as a new ranine to
bolster the tribe’s ranks.

Standing no taller than 4ft tall, ratlings, as their name implies, resemble
humanoid rodents. Although not much of a threat individually, ratlings
tend to attack in packs (of 4d6). Ratlings dealing damage via a bite may
infect their victims with the same disease that mundane rats do. The
chances of passing on the disease are identical to that of their giant-rat kin.

The Rat Pack

Moldy grain sits in overflowing bins inside this abandoned mill in
Torkstill. The grinding wheels still turn slowly, however, as the attached
waterwheel spins in the lazy stream flowing past the building. Three large
bins are overturned, spilling various grains across the floor. Dead weevils
litter the piles. The corn is contaminated with a wasting disease that causes
a victim to die slowly over 1d4 weeks unless he makes a saving throw.
The overturned bins hide holes cut through the wooden floorboards.
Anyone descending under the mill finds themselves in narrow tunnels
dug through the earth. The tunnel rooms are home to 4d6 ratlings that
frequently raid Torkstill for shiny objects, chickens and anything else
they can carry off. Their raids have spread disease throughout the village,
causing sickness and death in the good people. The residents are unaware
of the ratlings, and think they are cursed. Getting rid of the ratlings allows
the villagers to recover quickly.

Rat Trap

Six marble sarcophagi sit in this underground tomb. Each has a sculpted
lid depicting the person interred inside. Each sarcophagus has a name
engraved along the edge of the heavy lids. The stone containers each
have a smaller wooden coffin inside in which a member of a royal elven
family killed during a forest fire is laid to rest. Opening the plain wooden
lids reveal contorted, burned bodies wrapped in white linen. Each body
is buried with a silver pendant of elven royalty (30 gp). Possessing one of
the pendants draws the ire of any elves the PC meets. Ragged scratching
comes from one of the wooden coffins, like nails raking along the wood.
A giant rat gnawed a hole in the base of one sarcophagus and then ate
its way through the bottom of the wooden coffin to get to the charred meat
inside. The giant rat leaps out of the coffin to attack anyone disturbing its

The Desongnol rat in its larger form, about the size of a cat, is feared by
farmer, woodsman and adventurer alike. It has a rather large nose and an
extremely nasty temper and bite. When attacking, the Desongnol rat uses
its venom to sicken its prey (in humans, a -1 damage penalty or similar
effect) and then tears at it with its powerful claws to allow the rat to feed.
It has been said to give off pig-like noises and to have a particular stench
when in large numbers. These rats are usually found lurking near farms
and settlements where food is easy to forage. It is known for constructing
complex tunnel systems large enough for a small human/demi-human
(halfling sized or smaller) to enter.

Running of the Pigs

Squealing pigs charge through the thick weeds rising around the PCs.
Six feral pigs and a large boar race through the high grasses, their eyes
wide with fear. The pigs run past PCs unless they try to stop the sows. The
boar rips into PCs with its tusks before running onward. More grunts and
squeals follow close behind the fleeing pigs.
The swine are on the run from a swarm of 20 giant desongnol rats that
squeal like another herd of feral pigs. The rats leap and swarm over any
creature that gets in their way. The rats live in underground tunnels with
openings throughout the high weeds. The pigs blundered into the rats’
territory and found themselves surrounded by the vicious creatures. Three
dead pigs lie in the weeds near one of the dirt openings.

Strange Brew

A four-foot-tall iron cauldron sits in the center of this dusty laboratory.
A thick, green-and-brown brew bubbles inside the pot. Standing around
the cauldron are 4 skeleton in leather apron stands. Each stirs the contents
with a five-foot-long wooden paddle. Wooden shelves along each wall rise
to the 15-foot-high ceiling. Glass beakers contain dried flakes of all colors,
while metal boxes hold dried animal parts. Small cages house mummified
rats and other small animals. A wooden table against one wall has leather
straps fitted to its surface. Dried blood stains its surface.
The lab was used by a necromancer until his demise at the hands of a
sea hag. His skeleton assistants still go about the last command they were
given. The lab is also home to another of the necromancer’s creations: 6
wizard’s lab rats that live in holes burrowed through the walls. The rats
have the following abilities (or roll your own): ethereality, fire resistance,
flying, giant strength, invisibility and undead control. The skeletons are
under the control of one of the last rat. The rats swarm out of their dens to
swarm intruders after the skeletons attack. The stew in the cauldron has a

Raven Seer

A gold perch hangs from the ceiling of this circular chamber. Silver
embedded in the walls rises to a solid metal disc at the dome’s apex. A
metal frame door opens outward halfway up the wall, leading into a dark
hallway. The entire room feels like being in a gigantic birdcage. Beneath
the perch is a six-foot-square granite altar with a silver platter sitting atop
it.
A giant raven stands on the perch, watching visitors with a cool eye.
The bird cocks its head to stare at PCs, then looks at the altar beneath
it. The raven is extremely intelligent, and can predict the future to some
small degree. It converses in Common with anyone placing at least 100 gp
on the altar as an offering, and answers three questions. The bird is evil,
however, and answers just one question honestly. The other answers are
twisted lies designed to lead the asker into danger. The crow defends itself
if attacked, and curses the PCs before it flies out the open door. Anyone
failing a saving throw grows feathers and turns into a giant raven within

Deep Flyer

The sea is turbulent today, the waves rolling across the deep to batter
the galleon Melton’s Fury as it plies the Reaping Sea. The ship rises and
plummets as it rides the waves. The sailors hang on for dear life, speaking
in fearful whispers of a monster of the deep that hunts when the winds and
rain pummel the sails. They claim the beast from the deep chases ships
even as they follow the great whales, ready to strike without warning and
swallow men whole in its gaping maw. The last sound you’ll hear is the
quiet flap of its monstrous wings.
The beast is actually a giant manta ray that swallowed a halfling
wearing a ring of flying. The ring conveys limited flight to the manta,
allowing it to soar out of the waves and across the decks of ships in search
of prey for 4 rounds. The giant manta uses that time to rise out of the
troubled waters and glide across the surface of ships before diving again
into the depths. As the beast passes, it stings sailors and swallows others in
its way. Anyone who makes a saving throw dives out of the gaping mouth
as it swoops down toward them.

Love Stings

A sandy beach fills one side of this cavernous underground chamber.
An ocean of green-glowing water spreads out across the chamber. The
glow comes from algae floating atop the still waters. Splashing fish and
dropping rocks create wide ripples that spread in overlapping waves.
The sounds echo across the surface. The cave extends for miles over
open water, and the underground sea traverses hundreds of miles below
ground. A small rowboat sits anchored 500 feet offshore. A warm glow
rises around the rowboat from a small lantern sitting on one of its benches.
The water along the shore is home to 12 albino sting rays that gather
here for mating season. The rays are docile unless disturbed (or stepped
on). Anyone walking into their midst receives debilitating stings as the
startled rays rise up and attack. The rays are nearly invisible in the dark
waters. The boat contains a mummified corpse of an ancient dark elf
fisherman who was bitten by a sea snake and died atop the waters. The
lamp contains a lump of weeds that burns without heat to light the lamp
for one month. The dark elf has a belt pouch containing eight more lumps
of the mushy weeds. A flint knife on his belt ignites the weeds if they are
wrapped around it. If the weeds are set on fire with a normal flame, they
produce a noxious gas in a 10-foot-diameter that causes violent vomiting
(save avoids).

Death from Above

A murder of crows pinwheels through the air, the birds riding heated
air currents rising off the High Jald Desert. Driven into the burning sands
are four 10-foot-tall wooden posts. Strapped to the posts are the bodies
of a desert nomad, an ettin and a camel (the nomad’s). All of the corpses
are dried out and burnt from the glaring sun. The bodies are slashed and
torn, and each one is missing its eyes. Blood spatters the sand around the
remains. A cackle of 10 desert hyenas tears at the flesh of the dead, trying
to pull the bodies from the posts. The animals watch any approaching PCs
warily, baring their teeth and snarling, but the hyenas keep an eye on the
sky as well.
The true danger is the flock of 20 razor wings flying high above. The
hyenas drove the angry birds away from their meal, but the flock is circling
and reforming to attack the pack. The razor wings descend in a flurry of
feathers, claws and beaks to attach anyone near the posts. The hyenas have
the sense to run when the birds begin circling lower.

Recursers are intelligent entities from the Plane of Entropy. They are
never encountered randomly, but are drawn to the material world by those
who try to alter space or time through the use of magic. Recursers appear as
shimmering spheres of black electricity, which seem to absorb light rather
than emit it. When a recurser appears, it will begin moving towards the
one responsible for its appearance immediately, and cannot be diverted.
Recursers attack their victims by absorbing them with an entropic touch,
which passes through armor or any magical protection as if the target was
completely unprotected (AC 9[10]). Recursers can only be hit by magical
weapons with a bonus of +1 or better. These creatures - or manifestations
- are essentially mindless, and exist purely to destroy anyone or anything
that attempts to alter the course of fate. They do not bargain, nor will they
surrender. The sight of a recurser is terrifying, and anyone who observes
one must make a saving throw or be paralyzed by fear for 1d3 rounds.
Recursers do not need food or sleep, and will track the object of their
attention tirelessly until they are successful or defeated. There can never
be more than one recurser on the Material Plane at any time.

The Book of Fate

The Gerdant Library in Taharath contains an ancient tome called the
Book of Fate that was written by the Oracle of Destinic long ago. The
book contains a single phrase that is said to alter time and fate, allowing
the person speaking it to change the course of their life for up to one hour
already past. The phrase can be spoken only once in a being’s lifetime and
saying it again brings about instantaneous, irrevocable death. The entire
volume is filled with rules for saying the phrase, before presenting the
words themselves on the last of the 275 pages.
In game terms, saying this ancient phrase allows a PC to alter his fate
for up to one hour after a single event. If a PC is near death, he can “wish”
to be back one hour before he decided to enter the tunnel that led to his
doom, for instance. A losing battle can be reversed so a PC gets a “do
over.” The exact effect is left up to the GM. However, saying the phrase
draws a recurser after the PC within 1d4 days. The recurser attacks the
being who uttered the word. It vanishes if it or the PC dies.

Redwraiths are undead creatures that appear much like wights, although
their eyes are red and they are often garbed in crimson, for it is the only
color they can perceive, and they take red-colored items from those they
kill. Redwraiths are weaker than their kin, the wights and true wraiths,
but share many characteristics of this type of undead. If a redwraith hits
an opponent, the attack drains 1,000 experience points from the victim as
well as inflicting damage. Redwraiths are turned as wights, and take 2d4
points of damage from holy water. If a creature is drained of all life energy
by a redwraith, roll d100 to determine the result. 01-40: the creature rises
as a weaker redwraith under control of the original one, 41-50: the creature
rises as a wight (not under control of the redwraith), 51-00: the creature’s
body is animated as a zombie under the redwraith’s control.
The weaker redwraiths created when a full redwraith drains a victim
of all life energy have only 2 hit dice and drain only 400xp with a
successful hit. These creatures slowly gain strength over a period of years,
eventually becoming full redwraiths that are no longer under the control
of the original. For this reason, redwraiths of 3 or 4 hit dice may also be
encountered, these being able to drain 200xp per hit die of the creature.
These nascent redwraiths have Low intelligence, and can be tricked into
attacking a red item such as a prominently-flourished red cloak. Full
redwraiths will not be fooled by such tricks, although they are likely to
focus their attacks against anyone wearing red.

Caught Red Handed

A frail old man sits outside a sealed stone door set into a granite cliff
face. The old man’s face is scraggly and unshaven, and he appears not
to have slept for days. He wears a dirty tunic, and his arms and legs are
bone thin. At his feet are a pile of red robes of various sizes. A tear rolls
down his wrinkled face as he talks about his wife, Lividia, whose spirit he
claims is trapped within the vault by a ghostly entity.
The man is Pebkin, a liar and practicing thief, who discovered that an
ancient crown rests within the tomb. Pebkin believes the crown lets its
wearer walk through walls (it doesn’t). The thief can only dream about the
thefts he could pull with such an item. He’s tried a couple of times to get
the crown, but the tomb’s inhabitants stopped him each time. He barely
escaped and sealed the vault. Pebkin now sits outside vault, weighing his
options and plotting a way to get the crown.
Inside the tomb are 5 redwraiths that pour out the tomb’s stone door
if it is unsealed. Pebkin offers each PC one of the red cloaks at his feet.
He claims the red material prevents the ghosts inside the tomb from
possessing people. The red cloaks actually attract the redwraiths’ attention
so Pebkin can sneak in (wearing black clothing he hastily puts on) to steal
the crown. His plan is to put on the crown then run through the stone wall
to escape. That won’t go as well as he planned either.

Reef walkers are a cluster of anemones with a rudimentary intelligence,

tentacles characteristic of anemones. They walk slowly through coral
reefs, stopping often to flatten out into a less threatening shape and wait
for schools of fish to approach. Their random meanderings sometimes
take them onto land, where they can survive for up to two hours or so, and
they continue hunting along the coastline before returning to their reefs. If
a reef walker should stumble upon a coastal village, it may return several
times to find more prey, for a village full of humans is an excellent hunting
ground. If a reef walker hits an opponent, its stinging tentacles inject a

Anenomes Among Us

The people of the fishing village of Niborlyn rush to their homes as
the sun goes down over the waves, warning visitors not to go near the
waterfront at night. They lock their doors and refuse to open them until
the sun rises and the morning fog departs. Even the fishermen who make
their living on the water make sure they are ashore and in bed when the
sun goes down.
Anyone out after dark sees strange men march one by one out of the
deep. A cleric of Muir recently marched out to meet the strange, shambling
men, but her screams in the night were the last the villagers heard of her.
Her holy symbol still lies on the sand beach, but her body was never
found. The villagers are afraid to touch the gold medallion for fear that its
curse shall affect them.
The “men” marching onto the beach are 4 reef walkers that sleep in the
deep water offshore. They enter the village each night looking for people
out after dark. Anyone stung by their poisonous tentacles are dragged into
the water to be devoured. What remains of the cleric’s bloated body lies

Hot and Bothered

The dwarves of the Fire Guzzler Clan stand up to their beards in the
deep snow of the Frozen Wastes, their cheeks red and their breath frosting
in the air before them. The drifting snow makes moving hard, but the
dwarves stick to it. The dwarves carry 40 specially crafted arrows in their

dwarven craftsmen of Anvil Forge, but still must be tempered before they
are used. The dwarves haven’t been able to complete the task because of
the deep snow, but PCs may fit the bill.
To temper them, the arrowheads must be touched to the heated belly
of a remorhaz. The dwarves tracked one of the beasts to this frozen
wasteland, but running up to touch it is beyond their abilities in the thick
drifts. If PCs help, the dwarves promise them at least 10 of the magical
arrows
If PCs agree to help, they must successfully run up and strike the
remorhaz’s belly with a grasped arrow. A hit causes the arrowhead to
burn red momentarily as the magic takes hold. Each arrow becomes a
+5 arrow, and automatically slays any creature it strikes on a roll of a
natural 20. The remorhaz, however, doesn’t take kindly to the stings of the
arrows, even if they do just 1 point of damage per hit.

Retrievers are massive (20ft tall) spider-mechanisms built of metal.
Some claim that these infernal devices are actually built in the hells
and underworlds, which is not certain, but the malign intelligence built
into them is unquestionably evil and destructive. Every third round, the
retriever can shoot a magical ray from its eyes, having one of four effects:
fire, cold, or electricity (4d6 hit points, save for half), or flesh-to-stone
(save applies). No to-hit roll is required for the rays, but the particular
effect each time is random. If one of the retriever’s claws hits on a natural
roll of 20, it holds the victim and crushes for automatic damage in future
rounds.

The Invasion Plan

A monstrous black and silver retriever moves through the dark
underground, its eyes alight with a green glow as it goes on its clanking
way. Water gushes from the retriever’s joints as it moves. A dark elf
raiding party rides atop the creature like angry fleas. The 6 dark elves
attack with arrows and spells as the retriever blasts foes with its eye rays.
The dark elves joined forces with the malign retriever to attack the surface
city of Endabor. A map of the twisted underground tunnels is carved onto
the metal of the giant spider’s back. The etching shows the location of
an underground city of the dark elves, and various routes to surround the
surface city. The city elders reward PCs with 2,000 gp if the dark elves
invasion plan is averted. A water-filled compartment on the retriever’s
back contains the dark elf treasure: 1,798 gp, 16 black diamonds (1,500
gp), an unstopped decanter of endless water, and a medallion of ESP. The
drow lost the decanter’s stopper and never bothered to find another. The
water-filled retriever is slowed to Move 6 because of the weight of the
water inside it.

Ground-Shaker Goblins

People line the streets of Taharath’s main street to watch a parade of
people dressed in gaudy costumes marching through town. The costumedrevelers toss hard candy to the children as they dance and sing along the
parade route. The marchers wear medallions with a strange cube engraved
into its metal surface. The cultists are harmless worshippers of an ancient
cube design found carved throughout the city’s ancient ruins. They hold
the parade each year to celebrate their religion and hopefully usher new
members into their group.
The ground soon shakes and rumbles, and the excitement turns to panic
as 3 rhinoceroses charge through the parade-goers. People jump out of
the way of the large beasts, barely escaping the beasts’ giant horns and
trampling feet. Riding on the backs of the rhinoceroses are 3 goblins.
Each goblin carries a riding whip that he uses to steer the animal (although
not very well). The goblins jumped onto the rhinoceroses near the river
and guided them into the town. The goblins hope to cause a commotion
and eventually leap off and grab some loot before fleeing. The parade was
just a happy coincidence.

their midsections, and the weight of each person presses down on the
others already stuck on the horns.
Walking beside their “pets” are 4 frost giants out on a snowy hunt
through the melting glacier’s tunnels. The giants grab prey and push them

Rock Fall

Thousands of tiny rock shards and small round pebbles cover a 50-foot
stretch of a narrow pathway leading upward to a dark cave in the Hollow
Spire Mountains. The path winds around the low peaks, ascending to the
cave 40 feet above jagged stones in the rocky canyon below. The sound
of stones grinding together rises from the dark mouth of the cave. Anyone
trying to walk atop the rocky pebbles must make a saving throw to keep
from falling off the 10-foot-wide ledge. The bones of three skeletons lie
impaled on the rocks below, victims who fell off the ledge.
The cave is the lair of a giant rock weasel that hunts within the
mountains. The pebbles and rock shards littering the trail to its lair are
from the weasel’s breath weapon. If PCs approach the cave, they are
pelted by pellets as the weasel tries to turn them away. The rock weasel
easily sprints along the ledge to attack those who continue. The weasel
attempts to grab PCs in its mouth and throw them off the ledge.

Big Bird, Little Bird

Shattered trees trunks lie across the dry steppes. Pines, firs and elms
are splintered and shattered, as if dropped from great heights. Some of
the trunks rest at angles atop one another. The land around the trees are
gouged by the massive trunks, and PCs can find entire forests where the
trees have been pulled from the ground by their roots, leaving deep holes
in the dirt. One trunk lays atop three the rear halves of three horses. The
horses have been eaten up to the bark pinning their corpses to the ground.
The steppes are the hunting ground of a roc and a giant raven working
together to bring down prey. The raven finds food in the forest, and the roc
acts as “hired muscle” to bring down the meal. As the raven watches PCs,
the roc rips a tree out of the ground, and carries the huge trunk through
the air to drop on them as they cross the steppes. The falling tree does
6d6 points of damage to anyone caught under it (save to jump clear of
the falling tree trunk). The roc drops the tree, then swoops away to find
another to yank from the ground. The big bird continues softening up PCs
until the giant raven gives the signal to attack. The giant raven circles
above the PCs at all times, cawing instructions that the roc follows. If the
giant raven is killed, the roc eventually loses interest and flies off.

Ropers are shapeless but extremely tough-skinned organisms, with
about the body mass of a hill giant. They look very much like stone, and
can shape themselves to resemble a natural pillar, stalagmite, lump, or any
other simple rock formation. To attack, the roper hurls out long tendrils
with a range of 50ft (one per round); the roper can use as many as six of
these tentacles at a time. If the tentacle hits, it grabs the victim and draws
him 10ft per round toward the roper’s huge, tooth-filled mouth. The
victim must make a saving throw or lose half his strength points due to the
secretions on the tentacle (3d6 turns). A human has a 1 in 6 chance per
round to break the roper’s hold if his strength has been halved, 2 in 6 if his
strength remains normal. Ropers are immune to electricity and take only
half damage from cold, but they are susceptible to fire, taking +1 damage
per hit die inflicted by fires (e.g., a 6 hit die fireball inflicts +6 damage).

Lake Monsters

This underground chamber is filled by a wide lake. The cold, dark water
disappears into the darkness as the miles-long cave continues under the
earth. Albino fish splash, and glowing green algae cover the stones above
the waterline. A wooden pier extends outward from the rocky shore, its
planks warped but sturdy. Two rowboats tied to the pier float in the lake.
A rope is attached to a post at the end of the pier and leads off across the
water to another pole rising out of the murk about 20 yards away. Another
rope continues into the darkness in a different direction from the pole. The
rope guide weaves between the pointed tops of large rocks sticking out of
the lake. The rope continues across the lake.
The boats each have the odd phrase “Adventure’s Foray” carved into
their sides. The craft were brought here by Inores Cludding and Farg
Frensmal, two enterprising guides who hoped to jumpstart a tour business
into the Under Realms. They abandoned the venture after their first boat
was attacked and sank by 2 ropers living in the lake. The ropers lurk
underwater with just their heads sticking above the surface. They lash out
with their tentacles to pull people into the dark waters.

Orc Rot

The smell of decay is strong in this torture chamber beneath the curving
corridors of Froghell Keep. Six decaying orc bodies are spiked to the
walls with iron rods driven through their shoulders and thighs. The orcs
died nearly a week ago. Their bloated bodies are purplish and bruised, as
if something had chewed them up and spit them out. Tiny frogs sit on their
shoulders and heads, croaking noisily at PCs. The orcs wear discolored
leather armor. One has a pouch containing 15 broken human teeth, a long
braid of silver elf hair, 68 gp and a worthless copper ring.
The orcs are placed over spear traps that burst out of the wall if anyone
steps on pressure plates set on the floor in front of the bodies (2 in 6
chance of triggering). The spears burst out of the center of the dead orcs’
chests. Each orc body is infested with 6 rot grubs (36 total) that explode
outward with the spear tips. Anyone standing in an area in front of the
bodies must make a saving throw of be struck by 1d6 rot grubs as they fly
outward. If multiple people are struck, divide the grubs evenly.

Pudding, Rot
Hit Dice: 8
Armor Class: 6 [13]

Special: Disease, immunities
Move: 6
Alignment: Neutral
Number Encountered: 1
Challenge Level/XP: 9/1,100
Rot puddings are nasty subterranean creatures with slug-like bodies
made of some viscous substance, looking much like a dark grey jellyfish.
These puddings are scavengers in the dark caverns and hallways of
underground places. The carrion diet of rot puddings makes them into
seething incubators for all kinds of disease, and although they are
themselves immune to sickness they are highly contagious host-creatures
that can transmit all manner of plagues by the merest touch.
The diseases carried by a rot pudding can be transmitted in various
ways during a combat with adventurers. First, if the pudding itself hits
a character, the character must make a successful saving throw or be
infected. Secondly, if the pudding is hit by a bladed weapon (not a piercing
or blunt weapon), the wound will squirt a pus-like substance which will
cause the attacker to make a saving throw or contract the disease. There
is also a third possibility: if the pudding is burned by a fire larger than a
torch, the disease from its surface will temporarily be burned off into a
cloud of noxious smoke, which (unless there is some fairly strong source
of moving air) will be roughly ten feet in diameter and will drift in a
random direction each round at a speed of 1. Anyone in the cloud must
make a saving throw or contract the disease. There is one beneficial effect
of burning away the surface contagion of a rot pudding, which is that the
creature’s touch will not cause disease until 3 rounds have passed.
The disease, if a character is infected, has the following effects. The
character will immediately be wracked with pains and aches, affected as
per a slow spell (able to act and move only at half normal speed). After a
period of 24 hours, the character must begin making saving throws once
every 6 hours. The first failure of such a saving throw causes the character
to fall into a comatose state. The second failed saving throw causes
death. A cure disease spell will cure a diseased character, and although
a neutralize poison spell will not remove the disease it will grant a +1
on all saving throws. A character who is infected with the disease also
become contagious, although the contagion is much less virulent than the
concentrated effect of an actual rot pudding. Anyone approaching within
ten feet of an infected person has a 50% chance to have to make a saving
throw against contagion, and if the saving throw fails, the disease is
transmitted in the same form as if it had been contracted from the pudding.
Rot puddings are immune to cold and electricity. A cause disease spell
will cure one half of any damage that has been inflicted upon the creature.

A rot pudding crawled into the village well a week ago, poisoning the
town’s drinking water with contagion. Everyone drinking the contaminated
water contracted various diseases that killed them quickly. The only
survivors are six children who locked themselves in an attic room before
the disease spread to them. They live off rainwater, and eat dry rations
their father stored from his adventuring days. The children scream to PCs
that the monster “mostly comes out at night.” The rot pudding crawls up
the well when the sun sets to feed on the dead. The children won’t leave
the attic room until the pudding is dealt with.

drawn to the decaying bodies and moldy food contained within. Some
corpses lie in the streets, as if they tried to flee the doomed town. Others
are curled up in their beds, accepting their fate. All of the bodies have
hideous green sores and purple lesions spreading across their skin. Some
of the corpses are partially dissolved, their bones and flesh nothing but
puddles of gore trailing across the ground. PCs venturing into the village’s
square hear the sounds of children screaming and see small hands waving
from an attic window.

Rottentails are carnivorous, man-sized humanoids with rabbit-like heads
(floppy ears etc). The rest of their race, which lives on a distant planet,
moon, or plane of existence, exiled huge numbers of their kind who carry a
horrible disease endemic to the species -- these are the rottentails. Scabby,
smelly and forever drooling, the outcasts have survived the plague that
caused their exile, but they pass on a weaker strain of it to anyone with
whom they come into close proximity (20ft). Anyone coming this close to
a rottentail must make a saving throw: if the saving throw fails, the victim’s
rate of healing is reduced to half normal for the next 2d6 days, and he suffers
from frequent vomiting until the disease has run its course. Most rottentail
tribes live below ground, and all have excellent low-light vision. The brutal,
warlike culture of this species leads many of the rottentail warrens near
human civilization to work as mercenaries or scouts when they are hired,
and as bandits when they aren’t. Rottentails, perhaps because of their
otherworldly origins, are somewhat resistant to magic directed at them,
but they are unable to cast spells themselves. These scabbed and obviously
diseased creatures are far stronger and more vicious than they might appear
at first sight, and they are extremely skilled in combat, being exceptionally
adept at sizing up an opponent’s skills and fighting style. They tend to fight
defensively, without attacking, at the outset of most combats, which causes
enemies to attack at a -2 penalty to hit; each combat round spent evaluating
an opponent in this way gives the rottentail a cumulative bonus of +1 to
hit when he eventually decides to strike. (The bonus is only for the one
attack, and cannot be made at more than +3). Rumour has it that rottentails
often subdue badly outnumbered opponents, in order to feast upon their
still-living flesh back in the rottentails’ underground warrens. They also
have a strong breeding urge, and those who have established a warren are
very territorial. Rottentails who fight for a living tend to favour patchwork
leather armour and many wield twin short swords, although swordstaves (a
two-handed weapon that allows them to reach into the second rank of an
enemy formation) are also popular.

Rabbit-Proof Fence

An eight-foot-tall fence surrounds the prairie village of Auren Glen.
Two villagers armed with pitchforks stand at the gate, critically eyeing
visitors wanting to enter the town. Rabbit tracks in the dirt are evident
around the entire perimeter of the fence. The townsfolk are mostly simple
farmers, but the mayor is a talkative and friendly sort who is extremely
interested in adventurers. The down-homesy elf introduces himself as Elwood Doud.
Auren Glen is having a little trouble with rabbits. And by a little trouble, it
means big trouble with 9 rottentails that are establishing a warren a mile to
the west. The diseased rabbits assault the town each night, trying to wipe out
their neighbors. The territorial rottentails even dig tunnels under the walls
to get inside, but the vigilant residents are always on alert for trouble. The
mayor desperately pleads for the PCs to help end the rabbit infestation. He
doesn’t let on that the rabbits are giant, carnivorous humanoids infected by
virulent plagues until PCs are already marching off to battle.

Rusalka are undead maiden-witches that haunt the cold rivers and
lakes in which they drowned. In appearance, rusalka first appear to be
comely maidens, clad only in fog. Upon close inspection, however, they
are cadaverous with disheveled hair and eyes that shine with evil green
fire. Anyone who gazes into the rusalka’s eyes must save versus spells or
fall under the effect of a charm person spell. The rusalka then leads her
charmed individuals under the cold water to drown. Drowning victims
will awaken from the charm, but take 2d8 damage first (for the purpose of
the Rusalka, drowning inflicts 2d8 points of damage per round). The touch
of a rusalka paralyzes for 1–4 turns (saving throw negates). Paralyzed
victims are carried down to the monster’s underwater lair to drown. When
a drowning victim attempts to escape from the rusalka’s clutches, there is
a base 50% chance that the victim may reach the surface (and air) each
round, reduced by 5% for each point of strength below 16, and increased
by 5% for each point of strength over 16. Paralyzed victims obviously
have no hope of escape on their own and will soon drown. Magic weapons
are needed to strike a rusalka, and they are immune to mind-affecting
spells as well as other attacks and magic that do not affect undead. Once
per day, a rusalka may create a wall of fog. Rusalkas are turned as wraiths.
Females slain by a rusalka will themselves rise as rusalkas the next night,

The Fog Comes Rolling In

Villagers race through the streets of Niborlyn, running for the stone
church in the center of town. Mothers clutch their children tightly to them,
screaming for their husbands to hurry. Young families abandon elderly
parents as they scramble for safety. A cleric dressed in deep blue robes
stands inside a low wall surrounding the church grounds. He exhorts
everyone to get inside quickly. The setting sun casts an orange glow over
the strange proceedings.
Once everyone is inside, the church doors slam shut, and bolts are
thrown to secure the portal from the inside. Shutters are pulled tight to bar
the windows. A strong, unpleasant odor similar to sage hangs in the air
from clover-like green herbs growing wild on the church grounds. Holy
symbols hang on the doors and shutters, and more lie flat on the stone wall
surrounding the church.
After the sun sets, a fog rolls slowly off the waterfront and plunges
the village into thick mists. Figures move in the darkness, shuffling

Rust Monster

Move: 12

Challenge Level/XP: 5/240
These bizarre creatures are about man-size, and look vaguely like an
armadillo; they have armored hide, two antennae, and a long tail with
a flanged growth at the end. Rust monsters do not attack people – they
turn metal into rust and eat the rust – but they just can’t resist trying to
eat delicious foods like swords and plate mail, even if they are being
attacked. A hit from a rust monster’s antennae causes metal to rust into
pieces, and the same is true for metal objects striking the rust monster’s
body. Magical metal has a 10% cumulative chance to avoid rusting per +1
bonus of the armor or weapon.

The Hall of Trophies

Various stuffed animals and aberrant creatures stand in the foyer
and entry room of this vacant manor. The creatures are posed in lifelike stances, mounted to appear alive and deadly. PCs find a wyvern, a
displacer beast, a giant rat and other odd creatures in the room. One wall
contains insectoid antennae sticking from the cracks between the stones.
The antennae are dry and brittle, and fall to the floor if disturbed. Piles of
rust litter the floor around ugly yellow mannequins standing in the corners.
The antennae are from hundreds of rust monsters killed by the monster
hunter Holman Carth. The hunter never returned from his last hunt to find
a sea monster in the depths of Loch Brail and nature is slowly reclaiming
the empty structure. Already, a storm sent a tree toppling against one
corner of the house, shattering a window and allowing to real monsters to
climb in among the trophies. Drawn by the scent of the antennae glands,
2 rust monsters now live amid the trophies, waiting for their next metal
meal. The rust monsters are slowly dining on the metal in the house,
starting with the armor held up by the dummies in the corners.

Challenge Level/XP: 2/30
Sahuagin are fish-men with a lamprey’s round mouth filled with sharklike teeth. They live in salt water, sometimes at considerable depths, and
raid the surface world for plunder and sport. These beings are thoroughly
Chaotic and evil. Their society is highly organized, and their lairs are
often guarded by sharks. Some sahuagin will have entangling nets used
to ensnare opponents. These ferocious raider-predators hate aquatic
elves and tritons with an almost insane intensity, and will attack them
in preference to any other foe that opposes them in battle. The species
has two common mutations: 1 in 100 sahuagin are born with 4 arms,
and (raising many questions) 1 in 100 sahuagin are born identical in all
respects to a sea elf. Sahuagin leaders can grow to great size, and can have
as many as 8 hit dice.

The Sea Tower of the Sahuagin King

A swirling waterspout of seawater rises 100 feet off the Reaping Sea
in a twisting, twining column. The torrent spins ferociously, but retains
a squat shape like a liquid tower. Windows and doors remain in place
despite the spinning water. The Sea Tower of the Sahuagin King rolls
across the waves, moving with the currents. Splintered boards, broken
masts and canvas sheets spin in the outer watery wall of the castle. The
bodies of unlucky sailors twist in the torrent.
The tower is home to 30 sahuagin and their king, a 4 HD sahuagin
who wears turtle shell-armor (AC 3[16]) and can cast spells. The tower
is surrounded by a “moat” filled with 3 great white sharks that swim
around the twisting tides rising inside the watery structure. The sharks can
enter the tower base and swim up and out of the walls. The sahuagin king
directs the tower across the ocean to attack ships and coastal cities.

Fire Traps

Five-foot-wide spots in the Kanderi Desert radiate burning heat, the
temperatures rising above the hot sands around them. The circles are
nearly invisible, but PCs who make a saving throw may spot the circles
before they step on one. These spots are rare leftovers from an ancient
war between the salamanders and the first elves, when the races fought
violent battles across the planes. The salamanders sprinkled the fire spots
across sands before the marching elven army, waiting for someone to step
on them.
The spheres detonate in an explosive flash of fire doing 3d6 points
of damage to anyone stepping on one. The explosion also summons a
salamander trapped in stasis since the war with the elves. The salamander
immediately attacks, targeting elves over all others. These spots were
placed primarily in the deserts, but a few occasionally surface in the oldest
forests and most ancient cities. The spot vanishes after the explosion.

The Sand Screamer is a reptilian ferret-like creature the size of a pony,

dart about when in the open. Sand screamers feed upon tiny creatures
hiding from the hot sun, whether in the sand or up a palm tree, and gain
their name from the excited hissing noise they make when bursting from
the sands. Sand screamers can be trained as mounts for small desertdwelling humanoids, but they have unpredictable tempers and selective
loyalty.

Halfling Horsemen

A band of 8 nomadic halflings stand atop the desert sand, their arms
folded flat in front of them. Each wears loose-fitting, white clothing and
has a turban wrapped around his head to protect against the blistering
desert heat. The halflings stand perfectly still, like statues, but somehow
still move closer to anyone crossing the desert. The leader of the group
blows short blasts on a silver whistle, and the halflings change direction
and separate – all without moving a muscle.
The halflings are desert raiders who travel the Kanderi Desert in search
of gold and slaves. The halflings are master riders, capable of doing
incredible tricks while on horseback. The desert dwellers don’t ride horses,
however. Instead, they train 8 sand screamers that are incredibly loyal
to them. The halflings stand atop the backs of the burrowing creatures
as they plow through the sand. The halflings wait until the last possible
moment before signalling their ferret snake mounts to rise up and attack.

Satyrs are the legendary goat-men of the wilderness, with the legs of

carry pipes that can be used to cause charm person, sleep, or fear (in each

forest, satyrs are almost invisible unless they wish to be seen (90% chance
to avoid notice). Satyrs are well known for their lecherousness, and (to
put it delicately) they take great interest in human females. This race
is favored of the god Pan (and perhaps also by the powerful Dionysus),
which may be the reason why they are resistant to magic (50%).

The Sound of Music

A haunting melody plays through the small hamlet of Janoa. The sound
is intoxicating, drawing people to the burg like flies to honey. People
wander aimlessly along the single dirt road through town. The sound
comes from a pan flute sitting on a rooftop attached to a bellows and small
windmill. The turning windmill causes the bellows to pump air through
the flute to produce the enchanting melody. Anyone hearing it must make
a saving throw or be charmed. Herds of goats run free through the hamlet,
grazing on the flowers growing wild throughout the town.
The people of Janoa recently ran a satyr named Grover Hedge out
of town, and the ill-tempered creature swore to get even. He rigged the
bellows and pan flute on the rooftop and now claims the town as his own
domain. Grover sits inside the town hall on a large chair once used to
cut hair. If PCs enter the town without being affected by the charm, he
offers to trade goats for any females in the group. He’s a lecherous clod
who thinks he’s above everyone else. If attacked, the villagers rally to his
defense.

The Scorpion Curse

A lumbering zombie titan shambles across the Galafran Plains, his skin
sloughing off his emaciated frame. Bones jut from the skin stretched taut
over his enormous body. The haughty titan Antrapaeus made the mistake
of attacking the god of stinging vermin, and the Vermin Lord cursed
injected him with a wasting disease that turned him into a shambling
zombie cursed to roam the land. Antrapaeus is a force of nature, blundering
through the countryside, destroying everything he encounters. He has no
mind and no sense of the damage he is doing. There is no reasoning with
the monstrosity.
The titan’s blood still burns with the anger of the vermin god. Every 10
points of damage done to the titan causes a drop of blood to splash to the
ground. The blood forms into a giant scorpion emblazoned with the mark
of the Vermin Lord. The scorpion attacks those trying to kill Antrapaeus.
The vermin god doesn’t want Antrapaeus’ suffering to end any time soon.

A sailor dressed in rags sits on a large chunk of wood drifting in the

dehydrated. Instead of pleading for rescue, however, he motions any
approaching ships away with feeble swipes of his hand. He can’t even
raise his head to speak. The man is Captain Aldus Hanopar, the captain
of a sailing ship that sank within the past week. He has been adrift ever
since. The ship was attacked by a giant octopus that rose from the depths
to crush its hull. Captain Aldus was the sole survivor.
While the octopus is long gone, the captain is now being toyed with
by 2 tritons named Sigund and Royn and their “pets,” 4 white tiger sea
cats that swim around the floating plank. The tritons and sea cats attack
any ships approaching the doomed captain. The sea cats grab hold of the

for there does not appear to be a particular “species” of sea monster. Sea
monsters swallow their prey whole, like sea serpents: if the attack roll
is 4 over the required number (or a natural 20), the victim is swallowed,
will die in an hour, and will be fully digested within a day. Sea monsters
are not generally venomous. They are generally encountered underwater;
unlike sea serpents, they seldom venture to the surface.

Selfendel’s Guardian

The Iron Pillars of Selfendel are eight 100-foot-tall metal posts rising
out of the Reaping Sea where the deadly waters touch the glacial runoff
of the Wailing Glacier. Layers of rime ice surround the base of each pillar.
During the cold months, the ice is thick enough to walk from pillar to
pillar without trouble. Each post is smooth and nearly 30 feet in diameter.
Atop each pillar is a small empty brazier that contains a wire frame
about the size of a gemstone. If any gem worth at least 1,000 gp is placed in
the frame, the brazier lights and burns brightly, consuming the gemstone.
Each brazier burns with a different color. If all of the braziers are lighted
within one month, the pillars slowly sink into the sea. At the same time,
the Tower of Selfendel breaks through the ice to rise in the center of the
posts. The tower stands nearly 300 feet tall and contains the tomb of the
wizard Selfendel and his last experiments and treasures.
The rising tower releases the tower’s guardian: a dormant sea serpent
trapped beneath the underwater structure for nearly 200 years. The serpent
rises to the surface to protect the tower. It wears a golden seal through one
its great fins marking it as the property of Selfendel.

Gleaming onyx tiles line the floor of this long hallway. Twelve brass
lanterns hanging on the walls reflect moving patterns that seem to dance
across the reflective floor. The hallway leads into a 20-foot-square

Plant Life Reborn

A six-foot-tall silver staff is driven into the thick muck of the Sin Mire
Swamp. The word “Crokatowa” is engraved along its length. Moss wraps
thickly around the staff, and clouds of flies buzz around its length. Affixed
to the top of the stake is a small black gem worth 200 gp. Long ago,
Crokatowa was an earth elemental that attacked a tribe of halflings living
on a swampy island deep in the Sin Mire. The elemental destroyed the
village, shouting its name over and over as it tore the halflings apart. Even
as their families died around them, a group of halflings enchanted the
silver staff to trap and hold the elemental. The last halfling alive sacrificed
himself to get close enough to drive the stake into Crokatowa’s chest.
Removing the stake from the swamp or pulling the gem free releases
the elemental’s essence. Trapped for so long in the Sin Mire, the creature’s
elemental essence merged with the swamp moss. With the staff removed,
the creature rises as a 12 HD shambling mound. Striking the shambling
mound with the staff deals 2d4+2 points of damage with each successful
hit. The shambling mound focuses its attacks on the staff wielder.

Giant sharks are essentially no different than their smaller brethren,
other than in their great size. These massive predators are often found
cooperating with the evil sahuagin (q.v.).

All My Chums

A large inlet of the Reaping Sea rushes between two low cliffs. One
cliff slopes upward to a cave entrance blocked by two large boulders. The
heavy stones block the entrance, forcing any creature trying to get inside
to climb over the slick rocks. Outside the cave, a frame of tree trunks
holds six dolphins strung up with sturdy ropes. The dead dolphins are
gutted, their entrails spilling out and onto the sloping rocks. A steady flow
of blood and gore slides down the slope toward the water. The blood drips
over the rocks and falls 20 feet into the sea, creating a blood slick that
spreads across the wave tops.
The cave is the home of a stone giant named Granuul Coldstone. The
giant lives a solitary life, catching dolphins for its food. The blood from
the dolphins attracts 8 sharks into the cove to feed. Granuul casts his
dolphin leftovers into the waters to feed the predators he now considers
his pets. The giant tried eating shark once, but hated the taste. If disturbed,
he tries to grab PCs and toss them down the slope into the water for the
sharks to take care of. Anyone on the slippery, gore-covered slope must
make a saving throw or slide down the hill into the water.

Two large, sewn-together figures shuffle through the Maze of Xenso

Conundrums sits on the ancient king’s abandoned throne. Each golem has
a diamond embedded in its forehead worth 300 gp.
The bags contain 12 shocker lizards (6 per bag). The golems reach over
their shoulders and grab one of the lizards and throw the wriggling lizard
at intruders. The angry lizards spark like lightning as they arc through the

Shrangaathi are malevolent river spirits that spend most of their time
in the form of almost transparent river-fish. In this form, they pose no
threat. However, when a school of shrangaathi encounters a village that
does not have some sort of shrine or spirit to protect it, they will wait
until nightfall, change form, and attack the unprotected settlement. When
attacking on land, the shrangaathi become small humanoids with white,
opalescent skin, needle-like teeth, and spindly limbs. They swarm ashore
like a school of predatory fish, often stopping to feed on prey that have
fallen in battle against them - a single shrangaathi can devour a human to
the bones in 4 rounds and then look for more to eat. A single shrangaathi
is not a formidable opponent, but any opponent bitten by a shrangaathi has
a 5% chance (1 in 20) to lose 1d4 additional hit points from loss of blood
(at a rate of 1hp per round). Shrangaathi are affected by turning, although
they are not undead: if successfully turned (as ghouls), up to 1d10 of them
must make a saving throw or flee back to the river, never to return to that
settlement for 1d6+10 days.

The River Horde

The river village of Ransmet is built on a spur of land that juts into
the Kisme River. The deep river flows slowly past the wooden buildings
that are built right up to the water’s edge. A low fence of wooden posts
surrounds the village. Each post has a small carved fish atop it. Many
more colorful fish swim through the river, providing plenty of food for
the fishermen in the village. The normally pleasant village is in an uproar,
however, after the precious golden fish idol in the village’s center went
missing. The good folk blame the theft on a fox monk, and they are
correct. They’d go after the thieving creature, but they have bigger fish to
fry right now. Like staying alive through the night.
Each night, 40 shrangaathi rise out of the river to teach the town a
lesson for not having a proper shrine. The residents plead for help in
finding the missing idol – and the treacherous fox monk. They offer 100
gp (all they have) to anyone who tracks down the fox monk and returns
the fish statue. They throw in a basket of fish and pickled eggs if they
bring back the fox monk.

Shrooms are evil geniuses, toadstool creatures with considerable
magical powers. They lurk in the deep places of the earth and in dank
forests, plotting ruin against surface dwellers and scheming to gain power
for themselves by any means possible. They are highly adept with magic
that influences plants, and most of them are knowledgeable in various
forms of arcane study of other kinds, such as alchemy. Many, too, will
surround themselves with strange minions that they have created, grown,
or bred.
Shrooms are highly individual, and the Referee should feel free to
invent all kinds of these sinister malefactors. Most will have the spellcasting abilities of at least a fourth level magic user, and all have strange
powers to create and shape the plants of their environments (growing
and controlling them). Although these powers take time to employ and
will not be relevant in combat, they can be used to create a considerably
hazardous lair.
The flesh of a Shroom is delectable, but deadly. Any person eating
Shroom-flesh must make a saving throw versus poison or be affected
as if by a feeblemind spell. The condition may be reversed by a heal
or restoration spell. The effects of the toxin can actually turn out to
be beneficial in the long run; there is a 5% chance that a feebleminded
character who has been healed or restored will permanently gain a point
of intelligence from the effects of the Shroom-flesh.

My Dinner with Amanita

An idyllic garden hides underground in this quarter-mile sinkhole.
Flowering plants grow in abundance, and trees reach for the sky through
a hole in the rock above. A group of 3 bugbears sits on logs around a flat
mushroom in the center of the garden. Silver plates sit atop the makeshift
table. On the plates is a sumptuous meal of cooked venison topped with
sliced mushrooms, white gravy and chilled wine. All of the food is very
delicious. The bugbears ate some of the food, but enough remains on the
serving platters to feed a small group. The bugbears laugh uproariously,
ignoring PCs even if they come right up behind them. The bugbears look
at PCs with blank stares, then laugh all the harder.
Anyone eating the mushrooms sliced atop the meat must make a
saving throw or be affected by a feeblemind spell. An evil shroom named
Amanita set the table. The vicious shroom sliced off pieces of her body
to flavor the meal. She lurks in the trees, hiding among the flowering
plants until her poison kicks in. Amanita is accompanied by a shambling

The silent knight is an undead creature resembling a heavily armored
zombie armed with knightly weapons. These rather powerful creatures are
quite intelligent in a malign, inhuman way. Their presence is in some way
commanding to lesser forms of undead such as skeletons and zombies,
and when encountered in tombs or other houses of the dead they are
often accompanied by battalions of these creatures that have abandoned
their original commands to mindlessly follow the silent knight. The most
distinguishing feature of the silent knight, though, is that they radiate
utter silence in a huge area, a radius of approximately 200ft. The silence
is blocked by stone, but creeps down open corridors, often providing
warning of the silent knight’s approach with his horde of undead minions.
Within the area of the knight’s silence, it is impossible to turn undead or
to cast most spells due to the absence of sound.

Silent Knight, Deadly Knight

Ten suits of polished armor stand along the walls of this throne room,
each facing toward a throne sitting at the front of the room before a floorto-ceiling glass window. The armor stands at the top of three low steps
that run around the entire room. Each suit of armor holds a long sword
and a shield. Twenty-foot-tall red velvet tapestries hang on the stone walls
behind the armor.
In the center of the open room, 20 skeletons fight one another in bouts
of skill. The skeletal combatants dance and spin as they mock fight across
the tiled floor. A decaying body sits unmoving on a throne watching the
skeletons battle before it. Despite all the swords and shields slamming
together, no sounds leave the chamber.
The body on the throne is a dead elf placed there by the true master of
the chamber: a silent knight that stands disguised as one of the suits of
armor along the wall. The undead creature steps out to direct the skeletons
if PCs attack the fighting skeletons.

The Skarusoi are a race of insectoid bipeds from another world or
dimension. Tall and brown, they have shield-like carapaces on their
forearms and long feelers sprouting from their heads. They make a
muted chittering noise, but seem to communicate with each other through
a series of gestures and feeler flicks. Skarusoi attack by buffeting and
slashing with their forearm carapace-shields, twice per round, for 1d8
damage each. They may also wield weapons, preferring staves and pole
arms, gaining a +2 damage bonus if doing so. A Skarusoi can leap 50ft and
attack in the same round.
The Skarusoi also possess strange mental powers. If it foregoes a melee
attack, a Skarusoi may cause one of the following effects: (1) Cone of
Force, 30ft long x 10ft at end, hurling opponents away and possibly
knocking them to the ground (roll lower than strength on a d20); (2) Vortex
Leap, whirling the Skarusoi up to 150ft away; (3) Waves of Distress, 15ft
radius, causing all creatures drop what they are holding and clutch their
heads in agony for 1d4 rounds (saving throw negates); and (4) Blow of
Mental Force, causing 4d6 damage to one target within 20ft (save for
half). The Skarusoi may use the above mental powers a total of five times
per day. In addition, three or more Skarusoi concentrating together can
summon an insect swarm (as per the spell).
The Skarusoi are believed to be a mercenary race in a dimensional war
that has left countless worlds in ruin. When encountered, they are likely
to be upon some mission relating to this war, pursuing tactical objectives
incomprehensible to humankind.

An ankheg skitters around the outer ring corridor carrying 2 skarusoi

furies can be turned by clerics, as ghouls. They are not affected by sleep

The Lich’s Wish

A carriage made from the bones of giants thunders down the dirt
road, throwing up clouds of dust as it races along. The carriage creaks
and shakes ominously, but the bleached bones hold together. Pulling the
conveyance are 6 skeletal furies. The horses have no reins and no driver
to guide them, but it stops right beside PCs. The door made from a giant’s
pelvis opens on its own, but the carriage is empty. The vehicle has plush
cushions for seats, and a glass decanter of wine sits in a bucket of ice. A
note on one of the cushions reads “An invitation to my peers.”
The carriage belongs to the lich Letor Serane. The dread lich of the
dusty plains wishes to die, but refuses to end his unlife on his own. He
seeks adventurers of adequate skill and power who might best him in
combat. The skeletal furies are attuned to power, and seek out those who
might accomplish the task. If anyone boards the carriage, the horses set off

Four bone pillars stand about this 30-foot-square ossuary. Each fourfoot-diameter pillar is crafted from hundreds of random bits of bones
and skulls. A low wall of femurs runs from one pillar to the next. Four
skull chalices sit on the wall. Each chalice is filled with steaming blood.
Anyone drinking from a chalice must make a saving throw or be cursed so
he can only drink blood from that moment onward until cured. If the curse

If the drinker makes his saving throw, he hears a sibilant word

Fossilized skeletons are normally found only in underground caverns
or complexes that have been left undisturbed for millennia, although they
might also be found in inter-dimensional pockets, or in areas where the
fossilization has been deliberately induced. In some limestone caverns
where the mineralized water is in constant contact with the bones, skeletons
might also fossilize relatively quickly – over the course of a hundred years
rather than a thousand. Older fossilized skeletons may show pre-human
features; fossilized Neanderthal skeletons are not uncommon. Since
fossilized skeletons are effectively made of rock rather than bone, they
are harder to hit and harder to kill than normal skeletons.

Limestone Lizards

A network of limestone caves exist deep beneath the snake city of
Uroborus in the humid depths of the Seething Jungle. Ancient ruins fill
these deep tunnels, but the buildings lie crushed beneath boulders of stone
amid tons of dirt. PCs must break through limestone stalagmites and thin
walls of porous stone to make their way through these twisting corridors.
Carvings of snakes, lizardmen and other reptiles cover the exposed
buildings and walls.
The caves contain the remains of the first creatures to call the Seething
Jungle their home. The native lizardmen died during a natural disaster
that collapsed their tunnel homes into the ground around them. The
lizardmen’s broken bodies merged with the flowing limestone to create 18
skeleton fossils trapped in the walls. The thin, crusty rock is easy to break,
however, and the lizardmen fossils burst outward in a shower of stone to
get at those disturbing their rest.

The Skullmural appears to be a horrifying skull-like design carved into

power. It may seep slowly along walls, ceilings, and other surfaces,
positioning itself for attack, which can cause adventurers to think they
have made a mistake in mapping. If anyone touches the skullmural, the
creature gains a free attack, at +4 to hit. The skullmural attacks by fastening
tiny protoplasmic hooks and suckers into flesh to drink the victim’s blood
and other juices. Once attached, it drains 1d6 hit points per round and does
not stop until killed or driven off with flame, alcohol, or melted butter. If
blood is poured out near a skullmural, it will occupy itself with the blood
rather than attacking humans. A sated skullmural changes to a reddish

Blood Diamonds

This dead-end ossuary is accessed via a long passage filled with bones
shoved haphazardly into narrow wall niches. Skulls cover the 15-foothigh walls from floor to ceiling, each staring outward at PCs interrupting
their rest. Blood flows from holes in the ceiling and down the walls in
a crimson wave that washes over the bones and skulls. The skulls are
stained red from the deluge, and congealed blood drips from their jaws.
A metal container in the center of the room has a stone lid with the word
“Rest” carved into it. The lid weighs about 100 pounds. Inside the stone
box are 6 blood-red diamonds worth 200 gp each.
The diamonds are the source of the blood flowing down the wall.
Removing them causes the flow of blood to decrease. Returning the
diamonds causes the blood flow to increase. If all of the diamonds are
removed, the blood stops flowing and the walls move as 4 skullmurals
look for a new food source. The creatures attack any creatures in the room.

Living creatures are overcome by nausea for 1d6 turns (saving throw), and

Spray Tan

A partially dissolved suit of leather armor lies outside a three-foot-tall
opening that leads into a badger den in the rolling Iron Shale Hills. The
grass around the den is dead and yellowed, and a horrible odor hangs over
the entire area. A giant skunk recently chased off the badger that lived in
the den. The skunk also got rid of an exterminator sent to deal with the
badger. The skunk’s spray melted the man’s armor off his body. The skunk
charges out of the den to face PCs. Its diet of berries and pumpkins turned
its spray a deep orange. The animal’s spray stains anyone hit by it a dull
orange for 1d4+3 days. Bathing in lemon juice can remove the orange
stain and smell.

Sky worms, or “worms of the sky,” are spiny worms ten feet long, with
bat wings sprouting from behind a monstrous head. They are generally
dark purple-grey in colour, with red eyes; some have segmented bodies,
while others are more rubbery. The sky worm’s head is a nightmare
catfish-like thing, with long feelers and a gaping maw. Native to distant,
cloud-wrapped mountain peaks, sky worms can be captured and trained
to serve as aerial mounts.
A worm of the sky may bite for 1d6 damage, and lash with its tail
for 1d4 damage. The tail lash is capable of dismounting an enemy rider.
Trained worms of the sky can roll in mid-flight to tail-lash a mounted
opponent or block their riders from arrows. They are also trained to dive
after and catch a falling rider. Trained sky worms develop an empathic
bond with their riders, gaining a vicious +2 bonus on attack and damage
rolls if the bonded rider is slain or incapacitated. In the wild, they “dance”
in thunderstorms.

Bait and Switch

Coils of chain lie haphazardly across the rocky hillside. One end of
the 200-foot-long chain is attached to a large spike driven deeply into the
ground. The other end of the chain goes over a drop-off that plunges 30
feet to the angry waves of the Reaping Sea.
A sky worm is hooked onto a large metal hook at the end of the chain.
The flying worm struggles against the chain holding it to the hillside. It
can fly upward in a 400-foot-diameter circle, but cannot escape the chain.
The worm usually hunts sea birds flying below the cliff. An inebriated
titan looking for the perfect bait to catch a whale placed the hooks here
and covered the prongs with chunks of chicken to attract one of the flying
sky worms that frequent the area. He was too drunk to remember that
the worm could fly. The sky worm soars upward and attacks anyone
disturbing the chain.

Skygers are furred, serpentine creatures with the head and forepaws
of a tiger, fifty feet in length. They fly without visible means of
locomotion, slithering through the air like giant snakes. These vicious
and indiscriminate predators primarily hunt elephants, small dragons, and
rocs; nevertheless, they will swoop to attack any other creatures that look
large enough to offer a decent meal, a category that includes humans if the
skyger is particularly hungry or in an unusually bad mood.
The attack of a skyger is terrifying to behold. Horses and other normal
mounts will bolt as soon as they see the skyger descending. In addition
to its claws and bite, the skyger can sweep up to three separate opponents
with its long tail (using the same die roll for the three attacks) provided
that they are within 10ft of each other.
Skygers can swim at a rate of 120ft and hold their breath for long periods
of time; however, most skygers would rather die than be submerged.

Jungle Sacrifice

A terrified elephant struggles against stout ropes holding it in place in
this jungle clearing. It trumpets in terror, but the ropes hold it fast. The
elephant is a sacrifice offered by a jungle tribe of lizardmen. The lizards
fear a monstrous skyger that occasionally snatches the lizardmen from
the Sunning Rocks where they relax to absorb the morning light. The
lizardmen learned that feeding the flying behemoth an elephant twice a
month sates its hunger. The skyger arrives within 1d4 rounds. It swoops
down from the sky to snatch the elephant off the ground. Anyone in the
clearing makes a nice appetizer as the skyger swoops back for another

Slitherats are a bizarre variant of the giant rat, sometimes found in
places with heavy crystalline mineral deposits. These rodents have a long
(4ft) snakelike body covered in fur, with four almost vestigial legs on each
side. The long body tapers into a ratlike tail at the end, adding another
foot to the creature’s overall length. The head, although large, is clearly
that of a giant rat; but the long front teeth glitter, for they are made of
thin, sharp diamond. Because the teeth are so hard and sharp, slitherats
attack with a +1 bonus to hit, and inflict 1d6+1 damage. These strange
creatures use their teeth to dig through earth and solid rock when they
encounter such obstacles, but they pass through crystal as if it were not

Giant crystal shards grow randomly throughout this cavernous chamber.

the largest crystals are nearly a quarter mile long and hundreds of feet in
diameter. These shards are rife with tunnels that wind through their facets.
Living inside one of the biggest crystals is a colony of 24 slitherats that
are constantly gnawing new passages and nests within the shards. The
rats swarm out to attack anyone disturbing their lair. The body of a dead
dwarven cleric lies in the largest shard colony. The cleric still holds a +1

Perhaps the most dangerous of wandering monsters. Slithering trackers
are a form of transparent slug, possibly related to gelatinous cubes. They
are difficult to see (10% chance for a person to spot it, and he may lose
sight of it again in the next round). Unless they are starving, they do not
attack moving prey (5% chance to be starving). Instead, they follow the
potential prey until it sleeps or camps. They can ooze under doors and
through fairly small cracks, so even a barricaded room with a closed door
is probably not safe. When it attacks, the victim must make a saving
throw or be paralyzed by the slitherer’s secretions. A paralyzed victim
will be sucked dry of all body fluids in 5 turns (50 minutes), losing 20%
of hit points each 10 minutes.

The Mummy’s Cabin

The smell of dry rot seeps through the walls of this log cabin deep in
the forest. The A-frame structure’s peak rises nearly 30 feet in the air. The
door is boarded up from the inside, and more boards are fastened across
the ground-level windows. A cellar door is chained shut. The log-cabin’s
interior is decorated with stuffed animals such as grizzlies, elk, moose and
deer mounted in natural poses. Large bass stuffed with sawdust hang on
the walls. Dry rations fill a wooden cupboard. The cellar is mostly empty,
although it looks like a party was held recently to celebrate a freshly killed
boar. The animal’s carcass sits in the middle of a bloody silver dinner
platter on a wooden butcher-block table. The leftovers are dried out, but
still fresh. Upstairs is a different story. The bodies of six hunters lie in their
beds, their bodies wasted away to nothing but papery skin covering their
brittle bones. They look like mummies tucked into their bedcovers.
The hunters brought back more than their fresh kill last night. As they
made their way home with the boar, 6 slithering trackers followed them
to their cabin’s door. The creatures waited until the men were asleep before
moving into the unlocked cabin. The trackers killed all of the hunters in
their sleep and now rest inside the empty bodies of the stuffed animals
displayed in the main room. One camper escaped and was able to chain
the doors shut and seal the doors to keep the creatures inside. He died
after falling into a freezing stream and getting caught by a grizzly. The
slithering trackers attack anyone sleeping in the cabin, or quietly follow
PCs to their own campsite.

Sloorgs are a form of animate filth. Lumpy brown and oozing
constantly, with distended vaguely human-like features at one end, they
seem to arise spontaneously from poorly maintained sewers and middenheaps. Missiles are ineffective against them, adding mass to the body
instead of damaging it, and any hand-held weapon striking it may be
added to the body if the wielder fails a saving throw. The sloorg gains
one hit point for each item accidentally added to it, often making a low
rumbling sound like a mockery of laughter when it does so. The sloorg
flows through semi-permeable barriers such as gratings, chairs, and hasty
barricades, and might pause to spend a round adding the obstacle to its
mass. Anyone within 20’ must make a saving throw or suffer -2 to all dice
rolls from nausea. Anyone coming into contact with it – whether attacking
or attacked – must make a saving throw to avoid contracting a non-fatal
but debilitating disease. Sloorg take 1d6 points of damage per level of the
caster of a Purify Food and Drink, Cure Disease, Neutralise Poison, or
Locate Object spell. All physical attacks against a sloorg cause minimum

Wasting Away

The sewers beneath Bargarsport fill twice a day with seawater as the
tide rolls in. When the tide is out, waste from the city above washes into
the tunnels for the sea to remove later on. Sometimes, however, the filth
catches in the high shafts and broken basements where the sea can’t
reach. One such tunnel is filled with waste and offal washed down from
an aboveground slaughterhouse. The filth formed into a sloorg that roams
the sewer tunnels. It resembles a wave of diseased mud. The wall of waste
and other debris washes easily through the numerous sewer grates that
stop adventurers lost in the tunnel. The sloorg knows the tunnels well, and
avoids those that might lead it into the cleaner seawater. It tries to pin PCs
between sealed portcullises where they can’t escape it.

These tremendously large masses of slimy, rubbery flesh are completely

giant slugs can spit their acidic saliva at one target at a time. The base

10 feet of range, the chance to hit decreases by 10%. On its first spitting
attack, the slug only has a 10% chance to hit within 60 feet, and no chance
of hitting beyond that range. Some giant slugs might have more or less

Sluggish Motivation

A 50-foot-diameter wooden wheel spins slowly on a giant framework
holding it aloft in the middle of the Koft Badlands. Massive redwood tree
trunks support the rotating structure. Anyone getting close to the wheel
hears loud screams of terror coming from within the sealed wooden
structure. The wheel is attached to a pulley system that lifts a series of
wooden buckets out of a massive sinkhole nearby. Tree trunks are driven
into the side of the pit, forming a ladder that descends into the deep earth.
The wooden buckets rise out of the pit and dump piles of rock and dirt into
a sifter situated over the pit. The sifter works back and forth to separate the
dirt and rock. Sitting in the sifter are 16 uncut rubies worth 2,300 gp total.
A cunning group of 4 fire giants built the wheel to help them mine the
depths much easier. To power the wheel, the giants abduct desert nomads
and dump them into the enclosed wheel through a small locked door.
Currently 20 nomads run inside the wheel. To keep them moving (and to
motivate them so they don’t stop), the giants also placed a giant slug in the
wheel behind the people.
The slug now chases the people around the wheel, its bulk slowly
turning the device. If the wheel stops, the slug catches and devours the
people inside within 1d4+1 rounds. An outer hatch can be pried open
to help the nomads escape, although it also grants the slug its freedom.
The giants climb back to the surface within 2d4 rounds to find out what
happened to the wheel and to replace the escapees if necessary. PCs are
suitable replacements in the giants’ eyes.

A Sorcerer Ox may at first glance be mistaken for a Minotaur.
It is a member of a race of humanoid oxen, gifted with magical
abilities, clad in an embroidered silken robe, taller than humans, and
bearing long curving horns capped with tassels. The clothing and
jewellery of a sorcerer ox is worth 200-500 GP, and each has a 25%
chance of possessing a minor magical item usable by magic-users.
The great size and strength of a sorcerer ox grants it a +2 damage bonus
when wielding weapons (usually an ornate staff). All sorcerer oxen have
the spell abilities of a magic-user of level 5 (more powerful ones exist
as well), and prefer spells with an elemental theme (metal, flame, wind,
water, and wood). Twice per day they may catch a weapon aimed at them
and cause it to rot or rust away within seconds. Each morning they consult
their horoscopes for favourable signs, and so once per day may add a
+2 bonus to any one dice roll. However, if they neglect to observe their
chosen taboo (not drinking alcoholic beverages, for example, or making
an offering of incense to nature spirits) they suffer a -2 penalty to all dice
rolls relating to their spells on that day. Lastly, anyone who speaks with
a sorcerer ox for more than 1 turn will act as if under a Charm Person
spell, although the good-natured sorcerer ox will be loath to exploit this
effect of their eloquence and trustworthiness unless in dire circumstances.
Having the strength and stamina of an ox, a sorcerer ox is willing to
undertake hard work if he should fall upon hard times, and one of them
can easily perform the work of three manual laborers.

A staff with a carved bull’s head atop it is driven into the paving stones
in the center of the small village of Callots Mill. Necklaces hang from a
small crossbar beneath the bull’s head. Most of the necklaces are worthless,
but a few are made with real jewels (75 gp worth). The residents of the
small timber-cutting community ignore the staff, giving it a wide berth as
they go about their daily routines.
The staff belongs to the sorcerer ox Jantullus Maxilcilus. The strange
creature strode into town nearly a week ago and declared himself the
protector of the poor people of Callots Mill. His bodyguards, 3 minotaurs
with bronze-tipped horns, backed up his declaration.
The sorcerer ox now claims the town’s feast hall as his own, and the
minotaurs use side rooms as barracks. Jantullus hears cases brought
before him, and serves as judge and jury on disputes between neighbors.
His minotaur minions serve as executioners, although they accept and

Sorcery Leeches resemble, well…leeches. These tiny critters are often
used by Wizards and Mages to subtly deplete an arcane foe’s magical
arsenal. If a Sorcery Leech attaches itself to someone, it will slowly
siphon off the spells pressed into the magic-user’s mind. For each round
a sorcery leech remains attached to a magic-user, it may deplete 1 level
worth of memorized spell (a sorcery leech attached for 3 rounds may
siphon a 3rd level spell). The damage inflicted by the leech’s siphoning is
so negligible that the wizard is usually unaware that something is amiss
until he attempts to cast a siphoned spell.

The Way the Magic Died

A pointed red and green velvet wizard’s hat sits on a fake wooden head
on a four-foot-tall broom-like stand in front of a full-length silver mirror.
The hat has a jaunty, gold-colored brim that wraps around it. The wooden
head has a large gash slashed deeply across its face.
A sorcery leech recently laid eggs inside the hat’s folded brim. If anyone
places the hat on his head, the person’s body heat causes 1d4+1 eggs to
hatch within 1d6 days. The sorcery leeches crawl down the hat and onto
the wearer’s head, where they attach themselves to draw off spells.

Challenge Level/XP: 7/600
These spirit-creatures inhabit ghostly planes of existence, but often
hunt in the material planes - often making their lairs in dark or desolate
places. They resemble spiders, but their eight eyes are human rather than
insectoid. They are insubstantial, and can only be hit by magical or silver
weapons; they are affected normally by spells. The soulspinner spins an
incorporeal web, and can shoot these out as a cone 50ft in length and to a
width at the end of the cone of 50ft. Anyone entering these webs (which
are visible but ghostly) must make a saving throw or become enervated,
operating as if at one level of experience lower than normal. Clerical
spells cannot be cast through the webs, although magic-user spells operate
normally for a webbed character. The webs adhere to anyone entering the
webs, but their effects wear off after 1d6 hours. If a soulspinner bites a
victim, the victim must make a saving throw or be affected in the same
way as if caught in the webs (and the temporary loss of levels is cumulative
if a victim is both webbed and bitten). Anyone killed by a soulspinner, if
raised from the dead, will have a chaotic alignment unless or until some
additional magical remedy is provided, such as remove curse.

The Web of Souls

Silk curtains flutter along a death chute sloping downward beneath the
abandoned Kilvyn Gorge Sanitarium. The chute slopes downward at a
20-degree angle. The bodies of those who died in the vile place during a
mad wizard’s “treatments” were pulled down the slope to a cave opening
overlooking Kilvyn chasm. Hired death clerics unceremoniously tossed
the bodies into the gorge for wildlife and the flowing river to dispose
of. Bloody smears stain the death chute’s stone ramp, and the spirits of
the dead still wander the halls. These ghostly manifestations are nothing
more than memories bound here by the misery they suffered. The ghosts
pass through PCs as if they were not there, going about their miserable
existence.
The haunted tunnel is now home to a soulspinner drawn to the miasma
of death and despair gathered about the empty sanitarium. The spirit
creature inhabits the death chute, living in the stifling darkness. It spins its
webs throughout the tunnel, but seeing them amid the gauzy silk curtains
and the pressing darkness requires a successful saving throw. The end
of the cave opening is covered in a web to catch anything sliding down
the steep chute. The corpse of a halfling thief dangles over the chasm,
his rotting leather armor one broken strap from falling off his remains.
A pouch dangling from his decaying wrist contains 45 gp, a +1 ring of
protection and a small knife for paring apples.

The spectral scavenger is an undead creature appears as a dark,
billowing, wraith-like creature, with a skull for a head and bony claws
for hands. It can attack with its bony claws, but will generally attack with
any magical weapons it has, or with its spell-like powers noted below.
These creatures can use any magical sword to hurl a Lightning Bolt of 5d6
strength, up to thrice per day. A spectral scavenger can also cause bony
hands to erupt from the ground, (twice per day) completely restraining
1d3 targets (range 40ft, saving throw negates). Being of a wraithlike
nature, these monsters cannot be damaged by weapons of a non-magical
nature. They regenerate at the rate of 2 hit points per round, except from
damage caused by holy water, fire, acid, or spells. If one slays an opponent
with a magical sword, it additionally regenerates 1d8 hp in that round. A
spectral scavenger will possess 1d3 magic items; the first will be a sword.
Magical armour will not be possessed, and nor will potions. Any scrolls or
wands will be used freely, and rings are especially prized.

The Spectre’s Blade

A kneeling statue with massive angel wings bows its head and holds its
palms upward to visitors inside the Reliquary of the Ancients, a vault of
black stone beneath Umbreth Abbey. The statue cries black tears that drip
down her tortured marble face. In the angel’s upraised palms is a gleaming
long sword. A leather scabbard sits alongside the blade. If the sword is
removed, the angel’s tears cease.
The weapon is a +2 long sword that belonged to a deadly spectral
scavenger. When the spectre was killed years ago, the blade was brought
to the abbey to cleanse the weapon. Monks of Muir placed the sword in
the statue’s hands so their goddess could personally bless the weapon. The
sword resisted, however, but eventually the goddesses’ will made inroads
in redeeming the black blade. The tears the angel cries are drops of
concentrated evil sucked straight out of the weapon. If left in the statue’s
care, the weapon is completely free of evil within five years.
If removed, however, the sword could prove deadly to any PC wielding
it. The sword works fine against any living foe, but fighting a member of
the undead unlocks the spectral spirit trapped in the blade. Every undead
killed by the blade further empowers the spectral scavenger. When the
blade kills at least 30 HD total of undead, the spectral scavenger reforms
and rises to reclaim its weapon.

Spectres are wraith-like undead creatures without corporeal bodies.
When a spectre hits an opponent, with either hand or weapon, the touch
drains two levels from the victim. Only magical weapons can damage a
spectre. In some cases, these terrifying creatures may be mounted upon
living beasts, if the beasts have been trained to tolerate proximity to the
undead. Any being killed (or drained below level 0) by a spectre becomes
a spectre as well, a pitiful thrall to its creator.

Death Drum

A large drum sits in the center of this dungeon chamber. Various
mallets and drumsticks sit on small shelves around the stone walls. Some
drumsticks are made of polished ivory, while others are crudely carved
from bone or wood. At least 30 pairs of drumsticks can be found. A few
small mallets with leather straps on their handles hang from rusted wall
hooks. A gold set of sticks are suspended by fine lines running from the
ceiling.
The drum summons spirits if the correct drumsticks are used. The GM
is left to decide which pair of drumsticks raises the spirit of a named
individual once the drum is played. The spirit speaks the answers to three
questions as if a Speak with the Dead spell had been cast. If the wrong
drumsticks or mallets are used, a spectre rises from the drum to attack
those offending the dead.

Parasitic spectres are like normal spectres, in that they are undead
creatures lacking corporeal bodies. Tortured by their insubstantial
existence, they hunger to obtain corporeal bodies by possessing humanoid
creatures. Possessed creatures are under the total control of the spectre,
although they are somehow unable to cause direct harm to themselves.
The victim of a parasitic sprectre may (at the player’s option) make a
new saving throw each round to expel the spectre; success deals 1d8 hit
points of damage both to the victim and to the spectre, and expels the
spectre. If a possessed creature is slain, the corpse will instantly transform
into an undead creature, having abilities identical to those of a wight. If
such a “wight” is destroyed, the spectre is expelled, taking 2d8 hit points
of damage in the process. Non-magical weapons cannot harm a parasitic
spectre. Note that parasitic spectres can possess corpses as well as living
beings, and transform them immediately into wight-form, but they cannot
possess corpses that have been dead more than a few minutes.

Wight Knights

Four armored man stride from the depths of this ice cave, long swords
raised menacingly before them. Their skin is pale and sunken, but their
glowing eyes are filled with malice. Each knight charges PCs, screaming
incoherently. The men are all that remain of Lord Mirstol’s famed Knights
of Insight.
The armored protectors discovered a strange field of heated brass
urns inside a cave in the icy Wailing Glacier. They ran afoul of a host of
parasitic specters drawn out of the containers by their body heat. The men
returned as 4 wights, still dressed in their once-immaculate armor. Inside
the cave, 20 brass urns sit in holes bored into an icy expanse. The tops of
10 of the urns remain sealed, but the knights removed the rest. The open
urns contain flecks of glowing green dust.
Each sealed urn still contains a single parasitic spectre trapped long
ago by clerics of Voard. The ice cave was sealed until a quake reopened it
for the knights to discover. The knights opened one urn, releasing a single
parasitic spectre that infected their quartermaster. The infection spread
rapidly until all of the knights had been possessed. If opened, the parasitic
spectres attempt to possess PCs and force them to open the rest of the
urns. What happened to the missing 6 wight knights is up to the GM.

The Convocation of Sphinxes

The Convocation of Sphinxes is a once in a lifetime (at least for the
sphinxes) gathering of the various elders. The gathering meets in the
Desal Vale amid the ruins of a forgotten civilization that only the sphinxes
remember. The ruins bear engravings showing men bowing to the wisdom
of the sphinxes and receiving the blessings of the gods.
The convocation is convened by the androsphinx Ama-Nemead, but
this gathering is fated for disaster unless the Thebian Enigma, a circular
puzzle bearing the words of the ancient sphinxes, is recovered. A thief
stole the relic after the last convocation (nearly 300 years ago) and divided
the relic into four pieces that have since made their way around the world.
The golden elements of the Enigma now rest in various locales where the
sphinxes cannot retrieve them.
Each sphinx elder brings knowledge of the whereabouts of one piece of
the relic, but the convocation requires aid recovering the relics. PCs who
accomplish the deed gain the respect of the sphinxes, a promise of aid in
times of need, and a king’s ransom in gold and jewels.
THE ANDROSPHINX ELDER: The Enigma’s central golden ring
is worn as a nose ring by an undead lich minotaur who holds court in the
Hellhorn Tower.
THE CRIOSPHINX ELDER: One hemisphere of the Enigma’s
golden globe is lost in the Nest City of Aarock, where rocs fly in deadly
formations and the birhaakamen rule with iron claws in towering nestbastions where men are kept in silver cages as pets.
THE GYNOSPHINX ELDER: The second hemisphere is a golden
orb welded to the body of a massive retriever walking the under tunnels.
Rumors say the retriever carries a dark elf temple on its broad metal back.
THE HIERACOSPHINX ELDER: The Enigma’s outer ring, which
is carved with the words of the ancients, is used as a bracelet by the wife of
the storm giant King Jorgas Shunurtilas. The golden circlet never leaves
the queen’s wrist and is said to speak to her of the deceit of man.
Any PCs who undertake the deadly trials of the sphinxes is assured a
place among legends. Any who seek to betray the convocation face the
wrath of the deadly creatures and their sphinx brethren.

Step Into My Parlor

Webs cover this grove of trees deep in the Kajaani Forest. The strands
are so thick that they weigh the tree branches down. Gauzy sheets of
webbing spread through the leaves, trapping birds and insects. Normal
spiders move through the webs, scurrying for the smaller bugs, while 12
giant spiders stalk the thick strands to get at larger meals. The webbing
parts near the base of one tree to form a doorway of sorts that leads inside
the tent of webs.

The spiders’ nest is the home of a nasty annis named Dreenis Mal.
Spiders crawl about her giant frame, and she sits in a throne made from
bones held together by spider webs. She is always found in the company
of 2 giant phase spiders, and can command the spiders of the nest to do
her bidding. Dreenis wears a silver crown that is shaped like a spider. It
allows her to communicate and control the arachnids. The crown grants
this ability to any who wear it, but has a 20% chance per month of infesting

Where’s Waldon?

A flamboyant thief named Waldon Canary thrives in the mean streets of
Bargarsport. He openly flaunts the law and even works against the thieves’
guild that runs the town. The brazen Waldon steals from the rich, the poor,
fellow thieves and even orphans. He is a sneak thief who wears striped
white and red clothing that makes him extremely easy to spot. But so far,
he’s been impossible to catch. Local thieves following the man claim he
just vanishes into thin air, even when being watched closely. They suspect
the thief uses magic to pull off his capers and then escape.
Waldon is indeed a thief, and a good one, but he’s got help in his
vanishing act. Waldon was badly bitten by a nest of spiders as a child
and is immune to spider venom. As an adult, he stole a small fortune and
paid a druid handsomely for the secrets to controlling one of the larger
breeds. When Waldon met his giant invisible spider Hugo, it was love at
first sight. Sort of. Waldon spent years teaching Hugo, and now the pair
are working together in Bargarsport’s mean streets to make a little profit.
Waldon steals items and then flees to where he knows Hugo waits. The
thief simply runs into Hugo’s webs, and the spider pulls the invisible man
to safety. Anyone else caught in the webs meets the spider’s venomous
fangs.

This race of spiders has completely adapted to living in dungeon and
dungeon-like environments. Its central body appears to be nothing more
than a flagstone with 6 chitinous legs sprouting from the edges of either
side. It has a mouth with fangs, two eyestalks, and two front legs ending
with hook-like appendages. All of its legs can be retracted into the stonelike exoskeleton. The hooked front legs are used to pry flagstones loose,
allowing the spider to hide as part of a stone floor, but they are also used
for attack and defence. The flagstone spider’s bite is poisonous (save at
+4 or die). When waiting for prey, the spider is undistinguishable from
other flagstones 90% of the time (with any adjustments the referee deems
appropriate). If potential victims fail to notice them, they will attack with
surprise 50% off the time (1-3 on d6). Some adventurers have reported
entire hallways floored with these vermin.

A flagstone corridor slopes down into darkness, running for nearly 300
feet. At its midway point is a 15-foot-deep concealed pit (1 in 6 chance
to spot; dwarves 2 in 6). Anyone stepping on the pit must make a saving
throw or be dumped into a 10-foot-by-10-foot room beneath the upper
hallway. The pit resets and locks for 1d4+1 rounds after it is triggered. It
can be forced open by breaking the trap’s hinges.
The pit has a flagstone floor, although four of the stones are loose and
are push atop other stones. Three mummified bodies lie on the floor. Each
wears leather armor and a short sword lies nearby. The pit is home to 4
giant flagstone spiders that kill anyone caught in the trap. The spiders
pried out the flagstones and took their place. They attack anyone stepping
on them as they look to escape the hole. The three bodies are fighters who
discovered the pits and couldn’t get out before the spiders got them.

Spiderweed is an ambulatory plant that has adapted to mimic the
appearance of giant spiders as a means of defense. A single spiderweed
is usually about the size of a dog, although they can grow much larger
in the wild. In conditions of poor light, such as in a dungeon or a dense
forest, one will appear to be a giant spider. If it is attacked, spiderweed
responds by lashing out with two of its thorny appendages. These cause
1d4 damage, and secrete a sticky, poisonous sap. This sap will stick to
flesh and clothing, unless thoroughly washed off. It inflicts no damage,
but causes a very painful rash for 4d4 hours that causes a penalty of -2 to

A struggling monkey lies bound tightly in green-and-yellow weeds
on the floor of the Seething Jungle. Sticky sap coats the monkey’s fur.
Three other dead monkeys lie in the dense vegetation off the main trail.
The weed-wrapped monkeys fight against the vines holding them, but are
unable to escape. Spidery weeds hang down from the banyan trees about
this small clearing.
The monkeys stumbled into a patch of spiderweed clinging to the tree
branches. The weeds wrapped around the monkeys, causing the primates
to fall heavily to the ground. There are 6 patches of spiderweed still
hanging from the trees, and 4 spiderweeds on the ground (including the
one wrapped around the struggling monkey). If the monkey is rescued, it
has a 20% chance of staying with its protector if it is given food.

Spine rats are as long as a human’s arm, red-eyed, and covered in
spiny overlapping scales; they appear to be the product of some sort of
crossbreeding between rats and lizards. A ridge of spines along the back
runs from neck to tail. Due to the muck and slime of their habitat, the
ridge-spines of a spine rat are likely to be tainted with soiled material.
Anyone jabbed by a spine must make a saving throw or contract a disease
that leaves them bed-ridden and fevered for 3d6 days. The bite of a spine
rat is not especially dangerous, and only leads to the risk of infection if the
wound is not cleaned.
Rare varieties of spine rats are able to shake spines from their backs
like tiny darts; and extremely rare large specimens may be able to walk in
semi-bipedal fashion and craft crude tools and weapons.

You Dirty Rats

A pair of outhouses behind the Grinning Troll Tavern are connected to
the inn via a wooden walkway obviously added to the tavern long after it
was built. The hall is just six feet wide, and slopes 30 feet down the hill
behind the tavern to where two outhouses stand. The hallway is open at
the end nearest the outhouses, allowing the elements to get inside. The
hallway’s roof extends outward over the privies to block the worst of the
elements, however. Both outhouses are the same inside and out.
The raised floor of the hallway add-on is a breeding ground for 30
spine rats. The rats can’t get into the tavern, since it is built on a stone
foundation, but they are free to scurry beneath the wooden hallway and
outhouses. The rain seeping into the poorly built hallway rotted the
floorboards, so that anyone using the hallway must make a saving throw
or step through a rotten board and onto a spine rat beneath the flooring.
The spine rats swarm out of the hole and attack those disturbing their nest.
The rats are covered with waste from the outhouses, and anyone struck by
a spine must make a saving throw or contract a debilitating disease.

The Spire Monkey is a two-headed, six-armed monkey that lives on
roofs (spires and minarets are preferred) and high in the treetops. In some
tropical countries they are tolerated in cities as messengers of the gods,
and roam temples with impunity. Omnivorous and foul-tempered, they
race from rooftop to rooftop and steal food (and occasionally loose coins
or trinkets) from the streets below. Spire monkeys attack by clawing, as
well as by throwing rocks or other small objects (such as roof tiles), and
can divide their attacks between two opponents. They can climb as fast as
they can run, and leap from tree to tree or building to building.

The Pickpockets’ Melody

An elderly peddler shuffles slowly through the city streets. He holds a
faded music box in his wrinkled hands and turns a crank on the side of the
box. The musicbox plays a tinny melody that echoes through the streets
and alleys. A mule pulls a cart of hay behind him, the animal plodding
along slowly behind its master.
The man is Torgus Bright, a crafty (and actually quite young) thief
who is particularly adept at makeup and controlling animals. Torgus
makes a living by walking through various cities dressed as an old man,
kindly accepting the charity people offer him. With him are 4 trained
spire monkeys that sleep in the cart his faithful mule pulls. The spire
monkeys leap from the wagon as they approach cities and make their own
way inside, then scamper along the rooftops looking for open windows.
The monkeys toss trinkets they find into the hay-filled wagon as it moves
slowly through the streets below them. When Torgus feels the time is
right, he walks slowly out of the gates and the monkeys follow.
If PCs are staying in an inn with open shutters, they can expect a
visit from the thieving spire monkeys whenever Torgus is in town. Any
stolen belongings are taken to Torgus’ home in a shaded valley outside
Bargarsport where he trains the monkeys and other exotic animals.

Giant squid are one of the more feared sort of sea monster; they can sink
small vessels and occasionally try to pick prey off the decks even of large
ships. These creatures are often mistaken for a true kraken, but they are
not intelligent. After a giant squid hits with a tentacle, it does 1d6 points
of damage per round, automatically, instead of the initial 1d3. Also, there
is a 25% chance that the tentacle “hit” pinions one of the victim’s limbs
(roll randomly for left/right arms and legs to see which is immobilized). A
giant squid can jet water out to achieve a movement rate of up to 27, and
can also release a huge cloud of ink to obscure its location. If a giant squid
wraps its tentacles around a ship, the ship will be crushed in 10 rounds,
taking damage throughout that time.

It Came from the Deep

Ships sailing out of the port of Duresteen north of the Shallow Glades
are finding themselves under attack from the deep. Three ships sank
within the past week, and all of the sailors aboard were lost at sea. Broken
bits of ships are occasionally spotted floating atop the waves, but rescuers
never find any remains; sharks and other maritime dangers fee quickly on
unfortunate sailors splashing in the water. A rare few of the biggest ships
limped back to port, their hulls cracked, their masts split, but the ships
somehow still afloat. The fearful sailors claimed the sea erupted around
them as the ship began tearing itself apart. Sailors were smashed across
the deck, but nothing was seen.
An experiment recently escaped from the undersea kingdom of Cnidaria
and swims the deep waters as it searches for prey. A giant squid was made
permanently invisible by the triton rulers who planned to use the sea beast
as a weapon against the surface world. The sea monster strikes ships from
below, wrapping its invisible tentacles tightly around their hulls. Despite
its invisible nature, the creature is easy to spot from the damage it does
and the explosion of water around the ship.

Giant aerial squids are cousins of the normal giant squid, but their
bodies are filled with lighter-than-air gases that allow them to float in the
air. In general, they are found in mountains, where they pick mountain
goats and goblins off the slopes as food. Giant aerial squid can grow up to
60ft in length. The squid’s tentacles constrict for 1d8+1 points of damage
after the first hit, and they are used to pull food to the sharp beak. When
a tentacle hits, roll 1d6: 1= both arms pinned, 2= right arm pinned, 3= left
arm pinned, 4-6= arms are not pinned. The tentacles can take 10hp of
damage before being severed, but attacking tentacles does not affect the
squid’s actual hit point total – only attacks to the body and head affect the
squid’s true hit points. These creatures are not good mounts, for they have
a tendency to reach back and eat their riders.

Goat Meat Surprise

The rocky crags of the Hollow Spire Mountains are a strange and
deadly place, with monsters that roam the high peaks looking for prey. As
the PCs climb along the high trails and through the rocky passes, a herd
of mountain goats scampers past, the animals desperate to get away from
something following close behind them. Some of the animals have weird
sucker welts burned across their backs and flanks. A few limp, falling

A giant aerial squid floats over the rocky crest of the ridge, its tentacles
swinging wildly as it reaches for the delicious goats. PCs are the next best

The star-mouthed worm is a horrendous creature 20ft in length, a

If the worm hits with a natural attack roll of 19 or 20, man-sized or
smaller prey will be swallowed whole. Being swallowed whole inflicts
an automatic 1d8 points of damage per round from digestive juices; one
can, however, attack the worm from within, using a dagger-sized weapon
against the worm’s internal armor class of 9[10]. Star-mouthed worms
cannot swallow more than two man-sized meals, and will generally seek
to retreat peacefully once they have filled themselves. If they accidentally

It’s Full of Stars

Star-shaped tunnels lead off from the points of a star-shaped room under
Mims Observatory on a barren hill near the Colter Flats. The observatory
is a round dome with a massive set of lenses focused through a glass
window on the sky above. The dome turns slowly as it follows the stars
across the sky. The observatory was built by a brilliant but star-obsessed
magic-user named Ferric Noccult. The observatory still functions,
although deciphering Ferric’s shorthand for zooming in on particular stars
takes years to understand. The tunnels beneath the observatory contain
thousands of moving gears and pulleys that rotate the dome.
In the underground passages is a strange menagerie of dead animals.
The dried body of a monkey with a star-shaped white patch on its fur
lies in a glass cage. A desiccated bull with a white star on its forehead
kneels inside a sturdy pen. Other dead animals have star markings on their
bodies. The menagerie’s star attraction, however, and Ferric’s favorite
beast before it ate him, is missing. The star-mouthed worm attacked its
owner when the tipsy mage – celebrating a successful acquisition of starshaped flowers – accidentally left the creature’s cage open. The worm
now roams freely through the tunnels as it looks for food. It ate the few
animals it could get to, while the others starved in their glass pens.

The wizard Nanwar Dukelt never cared for his familiar, a hideouslooking stirge named Mung. The neglected stirge stuck by its master,
however, occasionally draining the many servants who failed the wizard
in his quest to find the Silver Tooth of Bodacki. Nanwar eventually found
the relic, but the vampire servants of the tooth killed him.
Mung waited patiently for the hour when his master awoke as a vampire.
The pair have a symbiotic relationship now, with Mung attaching himself
freely to Nanwar’s withered corpse. Holes from Mung’s proboscis mar
Nanwar’s face, torso and arms. Most often, Mung hangs on Nanwar’s
back, drawing blood from the vampire as it feeds. At times, the stirge

A five-foot-tall boulder sits in the middle of a 30-foot-diameter sandbox
surrounded by white stone globes. Ripples crisscross the sand, creating
strange patterns across the surface. A low wooden wall of pointed posts
surrounds the sand and rock globes to keep the grit off the room’s tiled
floor. Colorful flowers bloom on the gray boulder. The bright petals are
the only splash of color in the otherwise drab room. A gleaming sword
leans against the rock. The point of the blade is stuck into the sand.
The boulder is a stoneflower that wanders back and forth across the
sand pit to create patterns in the sand. The globes are magical wards to
keep the creature contained in the circle. Removing the globes allows the
stoneflower to eventually get close enough to the wooden posts to knock
them down and escape. The weapon is a +l long sword stuck to the rock
by a strong adhesive. The sword moves with the rock, digging furrows
behind the stone. The creature attacks anyone stepping into the sand or

Thieves in the Night

Ancient graves ring the hill leading up to Poverty’s Bethel, a small
temple to Freya in the dying village of Fessel. Most of the gravesites are
ancient, but a few of the newer graves appear to have been dug up. Clods
of dark dirt and clumps of weeds are tossed out among the stones. The
tracks of scavengers weave throughout the dirt. A shredded chicken lies
on a weathered stone slab, and white puffs of loose feathers flutter across
the grounds. The elderly Almery Burgand, a priest of Freya, often hears
strange skittering noises at night, and fears going outside after the sun sets.
A pack of 20 Sumatran rat-ghouls is ripping up graves to feast on
the bodies of the dead. The rat-ghouls supplement their meals by killing
chickens that run free throughout the village. The rat-ghouls come out at

No Mercy

Rock benches rise up around a 200-foot-wide sand-filled pit inside this
deep underground chamber. Bloodstains splatter across the cold sands,
and skeletal remains rise out of the arena’s patchy floor. This forsaken
arena was once used by dark elves to prove their skills against men and
monsters from the world above. The vicious dark elves killed all those
who entered the pit with them. But finally, the games moved on, and the
arena was left empty as the dark elves sought new vices and dangers.
But the empty stands and sand pit didn’t remain empty for long. A

Anyone stepping onto the bloody sand is fair game for the aggressive

to a number of giant birds and other opportunistic creatures looking for
pre-built nests to claim. Currently, a monstrous sycorex nests inside the

and now soars in and out through the gaping hole. It leaps from the roof
and descends on anyone climbing up the staircase. It sweeps past, trying

creatures that intrude upon their territory. When leaping to the attack, they
gain a +1 bonus to hit. The bite of a tatzelworm is deadly, and a victim
must successfully save versus poison or die.
These cold-loving reptiles save at +1 against cold-based attacked, and
such damage against them is reduced by 1 hit point per die. They save
versus fire normally.

Lost in the Snow

Deep snows surround a caravan of seven highly gaily painted wagons
drawn into a circle on a frozen plateau overlooking a forest valley more
than a mile down a steep cliff. One wagon has the words Donner Circus
painted in flowing letters across its high wooden sides. Seven enormous
elephants slump in the deepening snow. Each elephant stands in wooden
yokes connecting them to the wagons. Snowdrifts rise to the bottom of
each wagon. The elephants’ massive legs are lost in the white powder.
The wagons’ doors and windows are shut tight against the cold, and fur
and cloth are pushed through openings to keep the freezing mountain air
out. The remains of a firepit sit in the center of the caravan, although the
deepening snow has nearly wiped it away.
The caravan met an unfortunate end after the lead elephant crushed a
tatzelworm hiding under a snowbank. When the caravan stopped for the
night, 9 tatzelworms attacked the elephants, killing all of the beasts by
burrowing up into their bellies from beneath the snow piles. The men and
women were left stranded — easy pickings for the aggressive reptiles.
One tatzelworm hides beneath each wagon, while the remaining two feast
on the undersides of two of the elephants. They attack anyone stopping to
investigate the lost caravan.

A tendriculos is a plant creature resembling a hillock or haystack, but
it is a voracious predator that uses tendrils and a powerful bite to kill and
digest prey. If the tendriculos hits with both tendrils, the victim must
make a saving throw or be swallowed whole. Each round spent within
the plant’s body automatically inflicts 1d6 hit points of acid damage and
necessitates a saving throw to avoid being paralyzed for 1d4+1 rounds.

Hay Horror

This two-story wooden barn has seen better days. The tangled trees of
the Kajaani Forest press tightly against its sides, probably the only thing
keeping it standing. Warped slats buckle and split along its walls, and its
oversized double doors hang askew, leaving the interior open to vermin
and thieves. Hooks on the walls where farm tools once hung are empty.
Nine stalls are empty but could be used to board horses for the night if
needed. A rotting leather bridle lies on the dirty straw floor. Mice skitter
noisily through the rotting hay. A creaky wooden ladder ascends 15 feet
upward to a partial loft that overlooks the stalls. Twelve rolled hay bales
sit in the loft, each broken apart and spilling molding straw across the
wooden rafters.
One of the stacks is a tendriculos that hunts throughout the area by
night. Anyone climbing into its loft is fair game for the creature’s deadly
tentacles and bite. Lying under one of the bales are the bodies of two
young elf lovers killed by the monster. If the bones are discovered and
not properly buried, the female rises in 2d4 days as a banshee that hunts
down the PCs.

Frog Pond

The Anuran Cliffs are green nephrite jade overhangs containing
numerous cave mouths rising up a steep bluff. A deep pool of algaecovered water sits at the base of the cliff. A waterfall steps down the rock
face to splash into the pool of water at the base. Logs roll lazily in the
current kicked up by the falling water. Eight jade sculptures of giant frogs
sit at some of the cave entrances. Each statue has greenstone gems (50
gp) for eyes that sparkle in the sunlight. Thick banyan trees grow around
the pool.
The caves are the homes of 10 thugtoads. The thugtoads leap from
their cliffs into the deep water below. They splash down in an explosion
of water. Four of the creatures emerge immediately riding on 4 trained
large giant frogs that help defend the pond. The other thugtoads clamber
out of the pool to attack.

Commonly known as the “Lemurian Wolf” or “Ekaru,” Thylacines are
carnivorous marsupials with a body somewhat like a wolf’s, although they
are not related to wolves or dogs. Thylacines are found in all climates, but
prefer forested hills to open areas. Hunters have killed Thylacines that
measured seven and a half feet from the tip of the nose to end of the tail.
The thylacine’s most dangerous attribute is a large powerful jaw that can
be overextended for a disproportionately large bite. They hunt at night in
groups similar to wolf packs. When agitated a Thylacine will rear up on its
hind legs and secrete a musky odor before leaping on the intended victim.
Though they have a poor sense of smell their eyesight is very sharp. Their
keen intellect and pack hunting instincts see them employed as guards in
certain nobles’ or wizards’ gardens.

The Capistran Wolves

The royal hedgemaze of the Capistran family fills a mile-square
wooded game preserve. Animals roam freely in through the nine-foot-tall
hedges. The maze is filled with dead-ends and vine-covered tunnels. A
redwood growing in the center of the maze has a winding staircase cut
into its outer bark. A magnificent treehouse stands in the high branches
and allows those getting to the center of the maze an amazing view of
the whole preserve spread out below them. Comfortable divans inside the
treehouse let people lounge in comfort and watch those below them lost
in the hedge. Dress-up jewelry (real diamonds worth 400 gp) is kept in
the treehouse, and crystal drinking glasses (120 gp total) sit on shelves. A
magnificent spyglass (300 gp) lets people get a closer look at the garden’s
sculptures.
At night, 10 thylacine are set loose to protect the garden and its
treehouse treasures from intruders. The wolves hound people into deadends before converging on them.

A dozen dead yaks lie on their sides in the high grasses of the Gorst

face first into the thick sawgrass. A bloated reddish bag the size of a small
calf lies in the middle of the yaks, its head buried in the neck of one of
the bovines. The massive bloated tick can barely move and is easy to
kill by simply puncturing its taut skin. It bursts in a shower of yak blood,
splashing anyone in a 10 foot radius. Rooting for blood among the dead
yaks are 6 giant ticks that crawl out to attack. They go for anyone coated
in the thick yak blood.

Cat’s Eye

A ziggurat of worn and broken stone rises through the choking tree
canopy in the Seething Jungle. Stone steps rise along one side of the stairstep structure. Engravings of snakes curl down the sides of the massive
temple, and carved squat skeletons hold up each of the six stairstep levels.
A bloodstained slide drops from the very top of the pyramid alongside
the stairs into a deep pit filled with thousands of brittle bones. The rib
cages are split and broken on the many skeletons dumped into the pit. A
three-foot-tall golden apatite gem (300 gp) stands in a golden frame atop
the ziggurat. The gem looks down on the jungle spread around it like a
giant cat’s eye.
The ziggurat is home to 8 tigers that sleep inside chambers accessed
via recessed doorways near the top of the temple. Sloping ramps lead into
the stone rooms. The tigers drag kills back to their rooms to devour. The
bodies of monkeys, jungle natives, and a gorilla lie inside the chambers.

The Mountain Cabin

A small mountain shack in the frozen wastes invites frost-bitten travelers
with a golden glow showing through the frozen shutters. The shack is built
on raised platforms that lift it above the ice and drifting snow. Boards seal
the crawlspace away from the drifting snow. An iron furnace in the middle
of the shack is empty, but nevertheless generates a warming heat and soft
glow that fills the room. Blankets cut from mammoth fur lie on woodenplank beds set against the wall, and more of the blankets are scrunched
into a pile in the corner. The doors of a cupboard are broken and shattered,
and dried foodstuffs are scattered about the room. Bags of dried fruit are
sliced apart. The beds, blankets and walls smell heavily of cat urine.
A sabre-tooth tiger recently claimed the cabin. It tore a hole in the
planks beneath the cabin from the outside to sleep under the magical
furnace. When it got hungry, the great cat broke through the floor and
climbed into the cabin to ransack the shelves. It marked its territory, and
then climbed back into the hole to curl up out of the cold. As it descended
back under the hut, it dragged some of the blankets with it to sleep on. A
few of the heavy hides got caught in the hole in the floor and block the
opening. The tiger tears through the hide to get into the cabin if it hears
PCs wandering about in its territory.

Titan, Cursed

Challenge Level/XP: 19/4,100
There are some acts so heinous and foul that the Gods – and fellow
Titans themselves – may banish and curse one of the titans to an eternity of
horrific toil. Now in a form no longer comely, but appalling and demonic,
its powers twisted, these extremely rare creatures will be found forever
attending to the geas placed upon them. In one case, such a titan was set
as a guardian to slay the endless stream of creatures that emerged through
a rift in space and time. Legends tell, too, of a cursed titan doomed to
guard a treasure so coveted that all manner of beings would seek to take
it…

A cursed titan does not have the controlled spellcasting ability of a
normal titan; its magical powers are still very much in evidence, but in a
wilder, more feral form. Each of these beings is highly unique, and their
powers will vary.

Aura and Surroundings The area around a cursed titan is dangerous to a radius
of 10ft. The exact nature of the danger may be one of the following: (1) fire,
(2) frost, (3) whirlwind, (4) attacking tentacles, (5) caustic air, (6)
lightning. The damage from entering this area will generally be 3d6, with
a saving throw allowed to take only half damage. Fire will burn flammable
items, frost will paralyze anyone failing a saving throw, whirlwinds will
throw people 30ft (saving throw allowed), tentacles will entangle people
(saving throw allowed similar to a web spell), caustic air will cause
additional 1d4 damage with no saving throw, and lightning will stun for 1d3
rounds and throw 20ft (saving throw allowed).

Bodily Powers A cursed titan will have two of the following three additional
abilities: bellow, persuade, or summon. Each of the titan’s two abilities may
be used only twice per day. Bellowing causes fear (saving throw allowed) to
anyone in hearing. Persuasion causes paralysis as all victims within
hearing drop all items and kowtow to the creature (saving throw allowed).
Summoning brings 1d4 creatures of CL 5 to the cursed titan’s assistance.
These might include (1) 4HD ankhegs, (2) chalkeion hoplites, (3) formian
warriors, (4) hell hounds, (5) jackals of darkness, (6) kurok-spirits, (7)
owlbears, (8) wights.

Magical Powers In addition to the above, a cursed titan will have one
beneficial power and one malevolent power. The Benevolent powers are (1)
Reincarnate, (2) Remove Curse/Neutralize Poison, (3) Flesh to Stone, (4)
Restoration.  Malevolent powers include (1) Stone to Flesh, (2) Earthquake,
(3) Creeping Doom, (4) Finger of Death.

The Titan’s Curse

An angry bellow resounds through the towering oaks. Trees crash to the
ground and the entire forest shakes under an assault. Birds and animals
flee before the destruction. A number of the scared animals are various
shades of green. Verdant bears lumber along, while jade and emerald birds
soar through the branches.
An angry titan named Leoburn stomps through the trees, uprooting the
massive trunks with his bare hands. His skin is a bright lime green caused
by eating berries tainted by a magical curse. The berries also affected his
mind, making him paranoid and hostile. He can be reasoned with, but
anyone pointing out his skin condition (or worse still, laughing at the odd
color) finds himself staring down one angry titan. Worse still, the color
spreads automatically to any creature within 150 feet of the titan within
1d6 rounds (saving throw avoids). The color can be washed off by bathing
in lemon juice. Anyone helping the titan remove the color wins his eternal
gratitude, but finding enough juice is a challenge.

A dead cow on the side of the road attracts fist-sized flies that buzz
noisily around the carcass. Maggots squirm and writhe on the dead animal.
The stench is horrible. Another dead cow floats in the water of a small
stagnant pond just off the dirt path. A wooden fence surrounds the field
around the dead animals. Each cows wears a silver bell (10 gp) on a frayed
rope around its neck. Mosquitoes buzz in thick clouds over the water.
The pond is home to a giant toad that killed the cows and is feeding on
the flies. It leaps from the water with a splash to get at creatures bothering
its food supply.

Two elf corpses sit beside a partially buried boulder in the rock

change of clothes, matching gold combs from their mother (30 gp each)
and 75 gp (their spending money).
The brothers were traveling through the badlands seeking a lost relic

The Pleasure Garden of Xanis II

A magnificent garden of elaborate topiary and sculptures fills the
grounds behind the chateau of King Xanis II. Stone fountains burble
quietly into wide marble basins, and birds sing a chirping melody through
the fruit-filled trees. Water lilies, hydrangeas, geraniums and rare orchids
grow on the well-maintained grounds.
But not all is right in the garden of Xanis II. The gardener recently
went missing, and three servants sent into the garden to find him haven’t
returned. The luxuriant garden attracted 6 giant poisonous toads that
hop through the wildflowers as they chase the three-foot-wide butterflies
Xanis raises. The gardener was the first to die after he pushed one of the
toads away from a prized orchid. The servants met similar fates. Their
bodies are hidden under various plants throughout the garden.

Toad-Hydrae resemble giant toads with multiple heads (usually 4-6),
although the body is somewhat longer than that of a toad, and the mouths
of a toad-hydra are filled with nasty, sharp teeth. These creatures have one
attack per head. Each head can attack either by biting or by flicking out
its long tongue in attempt to grab (and later swallow) prey. A toad-hydra
will not usually attack with more than two of its tongues; if attacking
with three tongues, all of the tongue attacks are made at -1, if with four
tongues, all the attacks are at -2, etc. If, however, the toad-hydra hits with
one of its tongues, the victim is immobilized and the hydra may begin
trying to gulp it down in the next round. Gulping attempts are treated as
attacks, but rather than dealing damage in hit points, success means the
victim is swallowed whole and will die in 1d4+3 rounds. Immobilized
opponents can attempt to break free (successful saving throw at -5).

A Light in the Darkness

A scream pierces the darkness, the sound rolling over the bayou. Off
in the night, a lantern bobs and shakes unnaturally 10 feet off the ground.
Another agonized scream comes from the direction of the bobbing light.
The whipping light creates arcs of red and orange through the inky
blackness.
A none-too-bright elven fighter named Nelion Brightwave was making
his way through the bayou by night when he stumbled upon a larger-thannormal toad-hydra. The toad grabbed Nelion in two of its six mouths and
holds him by his legs and torso. The lantern he trusted to get him through
the swamp swings wildly as the toad-hydra heads fight over the treat that
blundered into their path.

Toad-men resemble bipedal toads, with warty skin and webbed feet.
However, they have blunt horned ridges at the top of the head, and tusklike teeth jutting upward from the lower jaw. The creatures stand almost
seven feet tall, and they are bulkier than humans. The civilization of
toad-men can range from that of brutish cavemen all the way to highly
cultivated societies with refined arts (the latter are more likely to be of
Neutral or Lawful alignment, although this is not always the case).
In some cases, Toad-Men will be found as the ruling class or as war
leaders for tribes of thugtoads. These batrachian species do not appear to
be related unless the connection lies at some point in the very distant past,
but each of the two races can roughly understand the speech of the other.
For the most part, toad-men are a subterranean species, especially the
more brutish varieties, but they incur no penalties for fighting in sunlight.

Clever Old Toads

The sounds of digging fill this downward sloping tunnel in the Legene
Mines. Clumps of glowing moss are rolled into two-foot-diameter balls
and staked to the walls with iron spikes. Each moss-ball provides a feeble
yellow light but no heat. Two lines of nearly naked men and dwarves
stand along the walls. They are all chained one to the next via lengths of
iron chains running through shackles on their ankles. The slaves are thin
and starving. Each has a pick that he swings against the rock wall. A mine
car containing gold ore (200 gp) and a few diamonds (300 gp total) sits in
the tunnel between the two rows of miners.
Standing on ledges overlooking the miners are 6 toad-men and their 3
giant toad pets. Each of the toad-men carries a whip and a longsword.
The giant toads leap down to attack, not caring if they grab a slave or an
intruder.

Todawan masters are an enigmatic race of solitary giant toads that have
achieved mystic enlightenment. They wear robes and carry a staff. Living
solitary lives in the depths of dangerous swamps, todawan masters do
not accept students but occasionally answer questions about the future
when worthy individuals seek them out. Unfortunately, some todawan
masters go bad. These subtle servants of chaos and ruin may assemble
bands of thugtoads or other minions, and begin to act as evil masterminds.
Such chaotic todawan masters do not often leave their swamps, but their
influence can be felt far and wide through the use of assassins, spies, and
soldiery. Any todawan master (lawful or chaotic) is a formidable foe. In
combat, provided they have at least 40ft for the jump, they can leap into
battle and deliver a tremendously powerful kick with their hind legs for
2d6 points of damage; the victim must make a saving throw or be hurled
back ten feet to lie prone on the ground, stunned for 1d4 rounds. Todawan
masters can block missile weapons with their whirling staffs, with a 75%
chance to deflect incoming missiles before the to-hit roll is even made.
Their mental discipline is such that they take only half damage from fire
and cold. They are immune to all forms of mental control and illusion.
Once per day, a todawan master can make a powerful mental attack,
suggesting that the victim not follow some course of action. If the victim
fails a saving throw (made at -4), he will become unable to force himself
to follow whatever course of action the todawan master has prohibited.
The skin of a todawan master is coated in an extremely hallucinogenic
substance.

So Croaks the Master

A tall wooden tower stands in the Sin Mire Swamp. The structure
reaches nearly 40 feet into the air. Fireflies flit about the tower, and
dragonflies dart back and forth in lazy circles. A series of switchback
stairs lead upward to a small platform atop the tower. Waxy white-and-red
candles sit on the various landings and provide a weak glow. More candles
sit on the landing.
A todawan master wearing red robes sits in a lotus position in a small
hut atop the tower. His head is bowed and he holds a quarterstaff across
his lap. The todawan’s name is Inhoep Gress. He truthfully answers
one question for anyone who climbs his tower and seeks his assistance,
provided they bring his favorite delicacy: the forelimbs of a giant praying
mantis. He is accompanied by 2 toad-men initiates who sit on stools
behind him. Inhoep carries a bone whistle that summons a toad-hydra
from the bayou to his side. He sometimes rides the beast to get around
the swamp. Inhoep croaks out his pronouncements in scratchy Common.

At first glance, a Torthri may be mistaken for a well-fed leopard or
jaguar. While they are related to large feline predators, they are semibipedal and of near-human intelligence. In some lands they are venerated
as nature spirits and pass freely through humanoid villages. A torthri is
capable of walking on all fours, but it can also rise up on its hind legs, and
the elongated forepaws are capable of grasping tools, opening containers,
etc. When semi-erect, a torthri moves at a reduced movement rate. To
run, it must drop to all fours. A torthri can exert a magical Charm upon
humans and humanoids by meeting their gaze and concentrating for one
round. The saving throw against a torthri’s charm is at a penalty of -2,
and those charmed become the creature’s willing slaves and worshippers.
Whole villages have been known to come under the sway of a Torthri,
constructing shrines in which to offer up food and treasure. Although
charmed villagers will tell outsiders that their “spirit cat” is like an
overgrown pet, no domestic cats will be found in the village, for the
Torthri will slay or drive out all other felines.
If forced into combat, the Torthri can defend itself with claws and bite.
However, the claws are weaker than those of its feline kin, and its hands
are clumsy; it cannot use missile weapons or complex devices, although
it can handle simple weapons such as the spear, staff, club, and axe. It
may thus attack with a weapon and bite, and will do so if its true nature
is discovered. The Torthri is intelligent enough to realise the value of
magical weapons and shields, but cannot utter command words or wear
armour. Any treasure possessed by a Torthri will be stored in a village
shrine or hidden cave. There persist tales of Torthri speaking through their
charmed slaves by telepathy, and of whole villages starving to feed their
greedy idols.

Reign of the Cat

The villagers of Rytsyrym scramble for their homes when the sun
sets. Shutters are hastily fastened, animals are corralled, and doors are
locked well before the sun touches the horizon. The village goes silent
after sundown with the residents afraid to make even the slightest sound
lest they attract the demon cat. They won’t venture out until the sun rises.
Anyone pounding on closed doors gets quiet whispers telling them to go
away.
Soon after sunset, a troupe of 16 humans, elves and dwarves walks
into town from the forest. They immediately begin work on a wood-andstone building in the center of town. The workers move clumsily but
steadily as they convert the former temple to Muir into a shrine. Images
carved into the outer walls depict a cat walking among men who bow
down to worship at its clawed paws. The charmed villagers make no
moves against PCs. The dazed individuals direct PCs to the Great Spirit if
they try to talk to them.
Inside the temple, rows of newly built ledges rise into the open rafters.
Golden cat idols (100 gp each) stand in the room’s four corners. Nailed
to a small altar at the front of the temple are the bodies of several dead

Roll With It

A stone incline at the end of this rectangular chamber leads upward to
a stone balcony 20 feet above floor level. The balcony runs around the
entire room, and has polished oak railings. An oak banister runs up the
ramp. A dark idol of a winged bat sits at the far end of the balcony. The
idol’s metal exterior glows red with intense heat and it head swivels back
and forth as it surveys the room. Red velvet curtains tied with golden
tassels hang from the ceiling, blocking passages leading away from the
balcony. The room is stuffy and several degrees warmer than the corridors
leading into it.
The idol is a cleverly constructed furnace with a swiveling head that
directs heat throughout the room. The true danger in the room is a trapper
beast lying in wait near the top of the ramp to the balcony. The beast
closes tightly over anyone who walks across it. When it does, the monster
rolls like a giant ball down the ramp with the trapped prey caught inside it.

At first glance, a treacherous treasure appears to be an envious pile of
riches. In reality, a treacherous treasure is a large, slime-like creature that
exudes a sticky film from its pores. Throughout its life span, the slimy
critter gathers up various coins, gems, and riches found within most
dungeons. These objects stick to the slime’s adhesive secretion, giving it
the appearance of a pile of treasure. Once the slimy beast is slain, it will
take 1d4 weeks for the adhesive film to lose its bonding properties. Only
then may the adventurers claim the slime-beast’s hoard.

A caravel hangs suspended above the river by pulleys and sturdy ropes
strung up into two mighty oak trees. The ship’s crew swarms over the
sides and deck of the ship as it hangs in the makeshift drydock. The sailors
hang from ropes as they rush to fix a hole punched through the wooden
hull. The ship is the Stalwart Corsair. It has a large winged masthead
riding high on its prow. Captain Terrance Capstand commands his crew as
they chop down nearby trees to make repairs.
The sailors picked the wrong spot to make their repairs after they
slammed into an underwater shoal. They don’t know that the region is
under the protection of a treant. The sound of chopping wood brings the
treant in 1d4+2 rounds to investigate. It immediately awakens the two
trees holding the Stalwart Corsair to join it as it attacks the sailors. The
trees swing the ship wildly as they pull free of the ropes wrapped around
their branches.

Tree ghosts are the undead form of a Dryad who was killed by a wraith,
vampire, or other such undead creature. They are gaunt and emaciated
ghostly horrors, with fingers ending in thorn-like claws, reeking of rotting
plant matter. Vines of thorn and briar grow from a tree ghost’s body,
writhing around her like snakes. Tree ghosts are partially incorporeal,
and are invisible until they attack. In close combat, a tree ghost uses her
claws to tear at victims, but she can also hurl a spray of thorns from her
serpentine thorn-vines to attack a single opponent at a distance of up
to 60ft. Both the thorns and the tree ghost’s claws carry a virulent sap;
anyone hit by one of the tree ghost’s attacks must make a saving throw
or become ill with a strange delirium that drains away his willpower.
The victim loses 1d4 points of charisma per hour, and once his charisma
reaches 0 he becomes a servant of the Tree Ghost’s will. He will follow her
back to the Corpse Tree and begin sprouting runners and twigs, becoming
absorbed into the Corpse Tree (the victim loses 1d4 constitution points
per day, and upon reaching a constitution of 0 becomes part of the tree).
The process is very painful and foul to look upon. If the Corpse Tree or
the Tree Ghost is killed, anyone under the tree ghost’s power who has
not started the absorption process will regain lost charisma points at a
rate of 1d4 per hour, and will suffer no other effects. Those that have
already started to become absorbed into a corpse tree do not fare as well:
all constitution loss is permanent, and cannot be reversed without the use
of powerful magic. In addition to her poisonous claws and thorns, tree
ghosts can exhale an Insect Plague (per the spell) once per day. They can
also animate any wooden objects, plants, and other vegetation within 50ft;
these animated things can attack and ensnare anyone in the area. Tree
Ghosts are immune to normal weapons and can only be harmed by silver
and magical weapons. Magic fire affects them, but ice, electricity, and
acid have no effect, nor does normal fire. If a tree ghost is killed, but her
corpse tree is not, the tree ghost will be reborn 24 hours after being killed.

The Willow’s Lullaby

An ethereal voice sings a children’s lullaby quietly beneath a willow
tree in the Kajaani Forest. The tree’s drooping branches hang lifeless
like a withered shroud about the clearing. Under the tree’s canopy, six
headstones arranged in a circle mark the graves of children who died in
a horrible mill fire hundreds of years ago. A ghostly woman wearing a
shawl of leaves sits on the ground amid the graves. Her beautiful golden
hair flows around her lithe body, and clinging vines hug her form. She
sings quietly to the headstones, and touches the earth sadly.
The pale woman is a dryad named Melene slain years ago by the
vampire Valmont De Shade as he traveled the countryside seeking a
permanent lair. Melene is a tormented spirit leading a double life. Within

Dark tritons resemble their more benevolent cousins, the normal tritons,
but they are malevolent creatures. Just as the normal tritons are rumored to
be servants of a sea god, the dark tritons are servants of oceanic demons
of various types, most commonly the demon-prince Thalasskoptis (q.v.).
Dark tritons have tentacle rather than the fish-like “legs” of normal tritons,
and often ride giant moray eels as mounts when traveling in the dark
depths of the sea where their make their castle-like lairs on the sea floor.
For every 10 dark tritons, either in their lairs or in hunting parties, there
will be a leader with 5 hit dice, and for every 20 there will be another
leader with 7 hit dice. If a group with 50 or more is encountered there
will also be a chief with 9 hit dice. Dark tritons do not have magic-users
as many normal triton bands do, but for each 10 dark tritons encountered
there is a non-cumulative 15% chance that the band will include a cleric
of level 1d6 (check separately for each set of 10 dark tritons; there is a
chance that the band will include more than one cleric).
As with normal tritons, the leaders of the dark tritons (5HD+) are capable
of summoning aquatic beasts to do their bidding. Once per day, a dark triton
leader may summon sea-creatures, with the following results (1d6):
1. 1d3 giant octopi
2. 3d10 sharks
3. 1 sea serpent (q.v.)
4. 3d6 aquatic ghouls
5. 1d4 aquatic trolls
6. 1 sea-wight (an aquatic wight with normal abilities but swimming)
leading 1d6+2 aquatic ghouls
Summoning creatures, even if there are multiple leaders in the dark
triton band, is not possible multiple times; all nearby creatures will already
have responded to the first call.

Depths of Betrayal

A foot-long conch shell lies in the gray sands of Kullk Beach. Black
streaks and minute cracks wrap around the shell, but it is otherwise intact.
The shell tapers to a pointed opening on one end and has a wide opening
on the other, much like a trumpet. Blowing into the shell produces a deep
note that echoes across the water and causes a 10-foot-wide path to open
through the waves. The corridor descends along the seabed until it enters a
tunnel surrounded entirely by seawater. The passage leads a mile offshore
to a round water chamber nearly 100 feet beneath the surface.
Tied to an open oyster shell with wiry seaweed is a triton. The triton
breathes shallowly and appears to have been tortured recently. Open
wounds cover his face and arms, and whip scars mark his torso. He is
barely alive. Untying the triton causes the watery corridor to collapse,
starting from the beach outward to the circular chamber. A giant pearl
(200 gp) lies in the open shell. The circular chamber remains open with
breathable air despite the passage back to the land vanishing.
Lin-Talishan is a triton prince of the undersea kingdom of Effervelt.

He was recently tricked by a dark triton named Yennel Scald who
tortured him to learn the secrets of the triton king. Lin-Talishan tossed his
conch shell into the waves as he was taken, where it floated to the surface
and onto the beach. Scald arrives in 1d4 rounds with 2 sharks and 3
aquatic ghouls to halt any rescuers.

If rescued and nursed back to health, Lin-Talishan gives PCs a small
coral statue depicting of white and black tritons locked in combat.
Submerging the statue in water gives the PC the ability to breathe for one
day underwater. Lin-Talishan had planned to give the statue to Scald as a
token of brotherhood until the dark triton betrayed him.

Water Torture

The smell of rotten eggs wafts over a waterway filling the center of this
500-foot-long tubular tunnel. The brackish water is a couple of feet deep
and flows steadily out of the tunnel toward a grate that empties into the
sea along a steep cliff face. Flowing water rushes out of a small opening
broken through a wooden door smeared with grease and oil that blocks a
side passage.
The main tunnel is the hunting ground of 5 troglodytes. The creatures
reside in rooms above the tunnel and watch intruders through concealed
murder holes. When PCs near the wooden door, the troglodytes drop a
solid metal portcullis down the passageway behind the PCs to trap them
in the tunnel between the portcullis and the locked door. Once PCs are
trapped in the sealed tunnel, the troglodytes open the wooden door via a
series of levers and wheels in the upper chambers to release a torrential
surge of water. The passage quickly fills with water in 2d4+1 rounds. The
troglodytes drop into the chamber via a secret door in the ceiling to get at

Trolls are as tall as ogres, and just as strong. Unlike ogres, however,
they attack with claws and teeth instead of weapons. Trolls regenerate,
which is to say that any damage inflicted upon them heals within minutes
(3 hit points per round). The only way to utterly kill a troll is to submerse
it in acid or burn it. Trolls can even re-grow lopped-off heads and limbs.

Parts is Parts

A four-foot-tall pile of rubbery limbs, legs and even heads lies in the
center of this 15-foot-wide stone hallway. The body parts are all from a
troll, and most have decayed into putrid piles. The smell in the corridor is
intolerable. At the opposite end of the hallway is a stone shelf jutting off
the wall where the tunnel dead-ends. A sparkling diamond (400 gp) sits on
the shelf. A hovering halo of green fire dances above the gemstone.
The limbs and heads belong to a troll named Craqjaw. The troll wants
the diamond at the end of the hall, but a whirling blade trap constantly
slices off any body part the troll sticks in the blades’ path. The blades
are located halfway down the hall, and slice out of the ceiling, floors
and walls simultaneously to deal 6d6 points of damage (save for half).
Craqjaw hides under the pile of his body parts and leaps out if discovered.
Otherwise, the troll waits until PCs are killed by the blades or grab the
diamond before making his presence known.
The green halo of fire is a protective spell cast over the gem. It slices off
a finger of anyone reaching for the gem unless they make a saving throw.

Tsalakian
Hit Dice: 2+2
Armor Class: -4 [23]
Attacks: 4 weapon attacks (1d4)
Saving Throw: 16
Special: Incorporeal/teleport movement, perceive secret
and hidden things, immune to spells affecting a “person,”
saving throw against all magic, reduced damage from

Move: Infinite
Alignment: Chaos
Number Encountered: 1d3
Challenge Level/XP: 7/600
Tsalakians exist outside of normal space. It is said that they have no
individual wills of their own, but are instead the fearful servitors of
some greater malign power. They eternally scheme against, and are in
turn defied by, another trans-dimensional race called the Kzaddich (q.v.).
Tsalakians appear as tall men, completely enshrouded in cowled cloaks.
Although capable of speaking with any sentient being (an innate form of
tongues), their voices float bizarrely around them, as though through a
ventriloquism spell with a random range and direction. They rarely allow
their true forms to be seen, for they are difficult to comprehend. When
uncloaked, they have been described as a blurry whirl of teeth forming a
rough approximation of a man-like form.
Tsalakians can bend and fold themselves through space, and are therefore
extraordinarily difficult to successfully strike (thereby accounting for
their high armor class). Moreover, they are fearsome in combat as they
have the spell-like ability to blink at will. Their multiple attacks represent
their ability to strike from several directions at once. A Tsalakian may
divide its attacks among opponents within 20’ of itself. They may move
any distance in any given round, ignoring physical or magic obstacles in
their path. This functions as an innate form of teleport without error. They
can even enter concealed or hidden areas, as they do not perceive space as
others do, and can see “around” walls, floors and ceilings. Thus, they can
disregard held portals, walls of force and the like. Secret, concealed and
hidden doors and traps are always exposed to their weird senses, as are
hidden people. Note that they are, however, subject to illusions and cannot
perceive invisible, out of phase, ethereal or astral objects or creatures;
nevertheless, they are virtually impossible to take by surprise. They are
immune to “person” affecting spells, such as charm person. Tsalakians
are allowed saving throws against all spells of any kind, take no damage
from damage-causing spells on a successful saving throw, and take only
half damage if they save successfully. They cannot be restrained by any
impediment and act as if wearing rings of free action at all times.
Tsalakians possess the mental power to detect good, evil, and magic
at will, to cause fear (saving throw negates), and can sense the exact
emotions of any being within 100ft. Tsalakians are usually found in the
act of planning or carrying out some great ill, for they perpetually strive
to bend all other sentient beings to the will of their dread master. They
prefer to work through others, themselves remaining out of the fray if
possible, revealing their fearsome abilities only if pressed. Their hatred of
the Kzaddich knows no bounds and they will always attack these creatures
on sight.

The Head That Wears the Crown

An elaborate throne sits on a raised dais in this magnificent reception
hall. Tapestries that hung over the stone-block walls are now crumpled
on the floor. The doors are open and unguarded. Scratches across the tile
floor are the only evidence that the room is used. An unmoving skeleton
wearing vestments of royalty sits on the throne. It wears two gold rings
(60 gp each) on its finger bones and a jeweled crown (300 gp) on its
brow. Slumped against the wall and hidden beneath fallen tapestries are
16 skeletons of guards and servants. Their clothing is torn and ripped.
Anyone touching the crown must make a saving throw or be tempted
to place it on their head. Once the crown is firmly in place, the wearer
freezes and a tsalakian appears in the center of the chamber. The tsalakian
viciously attacks everyone in the room except the frozen crown wearer.
The crown is a portal that summons the vicious creature, but only when
it is worn by a sentient being. The tsalakian can exist only so long as the
creature lives. Once the wearer dies (usually of starvation), the tsalakian
is banished again. Removing the crown requires a remove curse spell. The
crown can be destroyed by dipping it into a heated forge of blue flames.

Tunnel prawns are scavengers resembling very large lobsters, with a
hard, rocklike shell. These creatures wander through subterranean caverns
eating bugs and fungi from the wall, floor, and ceiling. A tunnel prawn can
scale walls and move along ceilings with no more difficulty than walking
along a floor. These dungeon vermin are easily antagonized, and will
attack any living beings venturing near. One tunnel prawn can provide the
equivalent of a day’s rations. The meat is tough and very chewy, and keeps
for only one day, but is actually quite delicious. Some taverns, usually
those located near dungeon entrances, serve tunnel prawn as an item on
the bill of fare, and will pay up to 3 gps for a fresh tunnel prawn. The
prawns weigh about 20 lbs each.

Catch of the Day

A skittering rustle slides across the darkness of the ceiling of this
20-foot-wide-by-30-foot-long chamber. The ceiling rises 30 feet above
a red brick floor. Anyone stepping into the room has a 2 in 6 chance of
triggering an ancient trap.
If the trap is set off, a rotting cargo net spread across the ceiling drops
to the floor. Its strands are frayed and torn, and thousands of worms and
insects burrow through the knotted strands. The rope was designed to lift
intruders into the air and hold them until the fire giant who designed it
could retrieve his catch. The trap fell into disrepair after the giant’s death
at the hands of a pack of feral trolls. Now, the net simply falls flat atop
PCs.
The ceiling is alive with 30 tunnel prawn feasting on the bugs and
insects infesting the heavy strands of rope. The tunnel prawns charge
down the walls to attack PCs stealing their meal.

The Old Man and the Sea Turtle

An old man sits on the surface of the ocean, the rolling waves lapping
around him. He has a long beard and wears ragged clothing bleached by
the sun. The man’s scrawny body is burned from overexposure, but he sits
serenely as he stares toward the empty horizon. He rises and falls easily
on the waves.
The old man is Santiago, a druid who became lost at sea weeks ago
when his boat was attacked by a giant sea turtle. Santiago somewhat
befriended beast. The turtle doesn’t attack him when he’s in the water
— and even lets him ride atop its shell as it swims — but it won’t let
him leave, either. Santiago has survived so far by eating a dead marlin he
caught. The giant sea turtle dumps Santiago into the waves to attack any
ships approaching the old man.

What Lies Beneath

Six barrels tied together by ropes bob on the surface of Altsheel Lake.
A rope tied to the barrels dips into the water, the line taut. The barrels are
slightly submerged, as if something below is pulling them down. Each
of the containers is empty, although sealed with wax to keep them afloat.
Wooden debris floats around the barrels. A gnoll’s waterlogged body
floats facedown in the lake.
A group of crafty gnolls tied the barrels together to bring up their
preferred prey: giant snapping turtles that live in the lake. The gnolls’
strategy was to harpoon a turtle’s thick shell, and then loop the rope
through a hook attached to the roped-together barrels. They let the turtle
struggle against the barrels until it wore itself out and surfaced where they
could finish it off. During the last fishing trip, the turtle snapped the rope
on an underwater branch and turned back to attack the gnolls in the small
skiff. The turtle made short work of the gnolls as they splashed about in
the lake. The tired turtle is still underwater, but surfaces to attack anyone
approaching the gnoll or the barrels.

The Bounty Hunter

At the crest of the hill is an apple tree with fruit hanging on the dipping
branches. The sound of an angry horse kicking and snorting can be heard
coming from under the tree. A deep voice laughs at every sound the horse
makes. Anyone investigating finds a hill giant sitting with its back against
the apple tree’s trunk. The giant has a broken branch of apples in its hand
and casually nibbles apples from the leaves. A unicorn with its head bent
low stands beside the relaxing giant. A massive club lies on the ground by
the giant’s leg.
Kurg is a bounty hunter employed to find unicorn horns for an evil
magic-user. The dimwitted giant somehow discovered one of the
creatures, but couldn’t bring himself to kill the beautiful creature. Instead,
he’s determined to drag the horse back to the wizard alive and collect his
reward. Kurg has a unique strategy to keep the unicorn from getting away
when he sleeps or rests: He slams the (slightly dazed) animal’s head into
trees, letting its own horn hold it fast. The animal bucks and kicks, but is
unable to pull itself free. Kurg fights anyone trying to free the unicorn,
thinking they are looking to collect the bounty from the mage themselves.

By day, the urrslumber is a lurching heap of leafy vegetation, roughly
in the shape of a headless bear, with tangled masses of thorny limbvines extending from a twisted clump of pliable abdominal roots; when
stationary, it is nearly indistinguishable from normal plant life. It hunts
by ambush, sensing the vibrations of passersby and lunging forth to
grapple with its thorny limbs. Its thorns secrete a sleep-inducing poison
with effects that last for 1d6 hours, possibly less, depending on size and
constitution of the victim. The urrslumber drags sleeping prey back to its
lair (often within the root base of an enormous tree), binds the prey, and
awaits nightfall. At sunset, the urrslumber transforms into a jet-black bear
with red, sightless eyes. In this form, it hungrily devours the captured
prey and then falls asleep, transforming back into plant form at sunrise.
While in bear form, the urrslumber’s gaze causes blindness for 1d6 rounds
(saving throw negates). If it is killed while in plant form, the urrslumber
regenerates completely from its remains (even burnt ashes) on the next
new moon. Urrslumbers killed in bear form are permanently dead.

Sleepaway Camp

A small cabin sits in this clearing in the deep woods. It has six wooden
bunk beds for travellers and a small porcelain wash basin. A chunk of
lye soap lies inside the basin. A small porch wraps around the wooden
structure. Six rickety but usable chairs sit outside for anyone wanting
to enjoy the night air. A 5-foot-wide shallow firepit filled with thick ash
sits in a dirt clearing outside the cabin’s door. Someone recently used the
firepit to stoke up a small bonfire. Grass is scorched in a 15-foot-wide
circle around the ring of stones surrounding the ash pit. The low-hanging
leaves hanging over the area are singed and curled. A burnt axe handle
rests in a clump of wildflowers.
A group of loggers burned an urrslumber in the firepit. They tossed
the leafy creature into the flames and kept it there with their axes. They
cremated the creature, stoking the fires higher to burn its body completely.
The loggers departed the next day, satisfied they’d killed the forest demon.
They didn’t know the creature would rise on the next full moon. The
urrslumber rises out of the firepit in the moonlight, reforming into a jetblack bear with red eyes to devour anyone camping in the cabin.

Uruak, or “scrap gnolls” are a race of hyena-like humanoids from an
alternate reality, similar to gnolls in appearance but much more intelligent.
They are intelligent, civilised, and fanatically obsessed with mechanical
devices and inventions. The culture of their world is equivalent to the
Bronze Age. Scrap gnolls managed to survive magical cataclysms
and inhospitable wastelands by combining their scavenging and toolusing skills. Although their world is now believed destroyed, they have
somehow spread across the multiverse. Wherever they go, the landscape
is littered with smashed sand ships, exploded steam engines, and rusting
piles of scrap left behind their evolving technological skills.
Scrap gnolls spend most of their time creating and testing tools and
devices, for they are instinctively gifted artificers. Many scrap gnolls
are skilled in alchemy, clockwork, mining and smithing, and they may
possess crude explosives (3d6 damage in 10’ radius, must be thrown,
may have a timing device of up to 3 rounds) or arquebus-type ‘smokepowder’ weapons (1d10 damage, backfire and be unusable until repaired
on an attack roll of 1). Any weapons they make will be finely crafted and
lovingly cared for. In a group of 6 or more scrap gnolls, there will be a
leader with magic-user spells and the vision to direct the gnolls in working
together towards a major task, as well as a pet snake or scorpion as their
mascot. For every male actively inventing, scrounging, or repairing, there
will be a female of close kin seeing to the more mundane domestic tasks.
All scrap gnolls yearn to regain the expertise of building ornithopters and
battle-automata.

The Watched Clock

In the Urlick Wastes, a massive 40-foot-diameter metal clock face juts
halfway out of the shifting sands. Half of the clock rises 20 feet above the
ground, with the rest buried. Giant metal hands move sluggishly through
the clogging sand. A door in the side of the frame enters a nightmare of
copper pipes, bent metal struts and other bits of strange metals. Gears and
pulleys whir and click around curious intruders. Metal circular stairs lead
downward into a shaft descending 90 feet under the sand.
A lost colony of 20 uruak lives inside the clock tower. They have been
here a long time (before the desert was even named), waiting for the clock
to strike a specific time foretold in their myths. The uruak are peaceful,
looking only to maintain their clock and to keep it winding forward. What
happens when the clock strikes the appointed hour is left to the Game
Referee.
Despite their isolation, the uruak are under constant attack by an army of
15 formian scavengers (10 workers and 5 warriors) that are constantly
trying to dismantle the clock and carry off its inner workings. Any help
stopping the formians puts PCs in the uruaks’ good graces.

Up a Tree

The broken body of a fighter in plate mail is slumped against the bloody
roots of a tall cedar tree. The man’s plate mail is crushed around his limp
form, making his arms and legs jut out in unnatural directions. A crumpled
shield lies in the thick grasses. The metal has been bent nearly in half.
The branches and limbs above the man shake and shudder as if something
large hides among the leaf canopy.
Tung Antonfeld was a knight off to war who decided — unfortunately, it
turned out — to rest beneath the cedar tree’s quiet leaves and contemplate
his existence. The massive oak is a Jubokko that grabbed Tung and
crushed him to death as soon as the man fell asleep. Tung’s trusty warhorse
Oakstaff didn’t fare much better. The tree grabbed the animal and pulled
it in the high branches to consume. The dying animal kicks the branches
around it with its hooves. The branches shake under the weakening
assault. The jubokko drops the horse to get at PCs investigating the dead
knight. Oakstaff falls through the high branches, bouncing back and forth
before striking the ground.

Vampires are some of the most powerful of undead creatures. They can
only be hit with magic weapons, and when “killed” in this way they turn
into a gaseous form, returning to their coffins. They regenerate at a rate of 3
hit points per round, can turn into a gaseous form or into a giant bat at will,
and can summon a horde of bats or 3d6 wolves out from the night. Looking
into a vampire’s eyes necessitates a saving throw at -2, or the character
is charmed (per the Charm Person spell). Most terrifyingly, a vampire’s
bite drains two levels from the victim. Fortunately, vampires have some
weaknesses. They can be killed (though these are the only known methods)
by immersing them in running water, exposing them to sunlight, or driving
a wooden stake through the heart. They retreat from the smell of garlic, the
sight of a mirror, or the sight of “good” holy symbols. Any human killed by
a vampire becomes a vampire under the control of its creator.
This description will be recognized easily as the “Dracula” type of
vampire. Many other possibilities for vampires exist in folklore: Chinese
vampires, for instance, and blood-drinkers more feral than intelligent.
Plus, other cultural templates with different attributes could be created—
how about an ancient Egyptian mummified vampire, or an Aztec vampire?

The Patient Handmaiden

This immaculate chamber is decorated in finery usually reserved
for royalty. Flickering wall sconces provide golden light that fills the
windowless room. Liquid-filled ornate flasks sit on shelves all about
the room. Purple cushions rest on a plush red carpet and a low silver
divan stands before a gold-leaf bathtub. Plush folded towels sit on the
divan. Long white curtains hanging from the ceiling obscure the tub. A
woman lounges in the tub, her form obvious but her features hidden by
the curtains. A handmaiden dressed in a white robe kneels outside the
curtained bathing area, awaiting the woman’s command.
The woman in the tub is a recently slain adventurer named Regina
Bont. Her blood fills the tub, freshly drained out of slits cut into her arms,
legs and neck. The handmaiden is a vampire named Helene Sendriss
who drains beautiful maidens and then stores their blood in flasks sitting
on the shelves around the room. She keeps the blood for a “rainy day.”

Vapor Cranes make their homes where geysers spews and hot springs
make great boiling pools, arranging their rock nests so that they fill with
boiling water. Strangely, they do not eat, but draw their sustenance from
the steaming waters they inhabit. They will attempt to fly away if they are
endangered but they will fight to the death if cornered.
Touching a Vapor Crane without the proper precautions can be deadly,
for their bodies are boiling hot (1d6+1 hp/hit die). They are also able
to spew clouds of steam from their nostrils as both an offensive and a
defensive measure and will use this ability to flee, unless guarding a
nest. The steam cloud can be used in one of two ways (3 times per day
total): if the crane is attacking, it blows the steam in a cone 30ft long to a
width of 30ft, inflicting 1d6 + 1/ hit die. When used defensively, the crane
surrounds itself with the cloud in a radius of 15ft, which not only inflicts
damage but also obscures the bird from sight. In normal combat, a vapor
crane attacks with its beak, which is filled with needle-sharp teeth.

Vapor Cranes make their homes where geysers spews and hot springs
make great boiling pools, arranging their rock nests so that they fill with
boiling water. Strangely, they do not eat, but draw their sustenance from
the steaming waters they inhabit. They will attempt to fly away if they are
endangered but they will fight to the death if cornered.
Touching a Vapor Crane without the proper precautions can be deadly,
for their bodies are boiling hot (1d6+1 hp/hit die). They are also able
to spew clouds of steam from their nostrils as both an offensive and a
defensive measure and will use this ability to flee, unless guarding a
nest. The steam cloud can be used in one of two ways (3 times per day
total): if the crane is attacking, it blows the steam in a cone 30ft long to a
width of 30ft, inflicting 1d6 + 1/ hit die. When used defensively, the crane
surrounds itself with the cloud in a radius of 15ft, which not only inflicts
damage but also obscures the bird from sight. In normal combat, a vapor
crane attacks with its beak, which is filled with needle-sharp teeth.

The Angry Statue

A 20-foot-tall idol carved from volcanic rock sits amid banyan trees in
the jungle. The giant idol has large eyes, flaring nostrils and vicious fangs
like a monstrous tiki idol. Curls of steam rise from vents in the idol’s wide
base, and wisps blast periodically out of the nostrils. Ten-foot-wide hot
springs are located in the clearing around the statue; A small geyser erupts
every few minutes through the statue’s hollow center. The water jet blasts
upward and causes trickles of dark water to wind down the creases and
curves of the idol’s horrid face. A low basalt altar sits beneath the idol’s
face, its crystal top stained with blood and bits of gore. Grasses around the
altar are blasted and withered.
A vapor crane makes its nest inside the statue’s left nostril. The bird
shoots its steam cloud outward at anyone looking into the nostril, and the
rock channels the blast into the intruder. The altar normally takes the brunt
of the blasts when the bird is startled.

Trophy Room

Nearly 40 severed heads of dwarves, elves, humans and even orcs hang
from rusting chains in this dark dungeon room. Their eyes and mouths are
open, and many still show the terror of their last moments. Dried blood
coats the floor beneath the ugly trophies. The wide splotches mar the
tile floor. A few of the heads swing slightly in undetectable air currents
moving through the chamber. The room smells of decay. Hundreds of
chains with empty hooks on the end dangle among the heads. The bodies
are nowhere to be found.
One of the heads is a vargouille that sits on a small swinging platform
beneath a rusty chain. The demonic head keeps its wings curled behind it
until it rises up to attack. The heads are its trophies from its nightly forays.

These are the restless spirits of dead fighters and warriors whose
armor continues to fight long after they are gone. The armor stands six
feet tall (sometimes taller), and is usually of the plate mail type. Varn
carry enchanted weapons, usually a +1 sword or axe. Because it is an
animated suit of armor, it has immunity to charm, sleep, and cold spells.
However, fire spells do +1 additional damage to eternal gladiators. Varn
are typically not used to guard locations, as they will attack anyone who
gets near them on sight. They can be found in dungeons, or at the locations
of large battles.
A weapon that has been used by an eternal gladiator will be cursed

The Warden’s Tomb

A 10-foot-tall iron fence cuts through the forest, vines and weeds
growing up around it. Beyond the fence is a weed-covered clearing. Onefoot-square grave markers set into the ground are aligned in perfect rows.
Each bears a single, unknown number.
Dunkire Prison is lost to memory, but its cemetery remains. The
graveyard is nearly a mile square, but overrun by the forest it was hidden
within. Hundreds of bodies are buried here, each nothing more than a
prisoner number. These were the worst of the worst who died within the
prison’s walls.
A stone mausoleum in the center of the graveyard is the only structure
within the clearing. Cherry trees surround the stone building. Four carved
caryatids hold the roof. A weathered name on a marker over the door is
illegible, but the words “beloved warden” can be made out.
Inside the structure is a sarcophagus set into the tiled floor. It is carved to
resemble the man buried within. Standing before the grave is the warden’s
guardian, a Varn who fell in battle protecting the body from those who
would defile it, and continues to do so after death.

The Leper’s Curse

Disease struck the hamlet of Pyrot’s Grove many months ago. The
residents of the small town walk around dazed and confused. All have
painful red sores that are spreading over their bodies. Men sit on doorsteps,
too beaten down by cancers burning within them to move. Women and
children cough up bloody bits from deep in their lungs. Animals slink
along the streets behind their masters, the heads drooping. No one is
immune to the horrible wasting disease. The townsfolk believe the gods
are punishing them for turning away a leper who sought safe haven from
ruffians on the road. Worse still, some of the villagers are missing. They
vanished right out of their homes a couple of nights ago. The remaining
people are frightened and fearful of strangers.
The true culprits are 5 vierds living in a cemetery outside town. Weeds
cover most of the headstones, and all but one mausoleum has crumbled.
The vierds paralyze victims and drag them into the mausoleum to devour
at their leisure. Their forays into the hamlet contaminated the town with
the many diseases they carry. Getting rid of the creatures prevents more
outbreaks and allows the villagers to be cured.

Glowing Goop

Goopy footprints lead down the flagstones of this stone passage. Each
step glows a ghastly green in the darkness. A phosphorescent handprint
occasionally appears on a wall or door, although these are few and far
between. The prints eventually lead through an arched doorway carved to
resemble a demon’s face. A 12-foot-wide flowering plant spreads across
the floor beneath the archway, its fronds arching like a low canopy. Giant
tendrils flow across the stone floor, some winding through the broken
stones where the plant pushed its way out of the earth. The petals glow the
same nauseating green as the footsteps.
The plant is harmless, a mutant variety thriving in the nutrient-rich
earth beneath the stone hallway. It gives off fragrant pollen that smells
like rotting meat. The room’s true danger is a walking slime that sleeps
beneath the plant’s protective leaves. The creature is coated in the plant’s
phosphorescent pollen, which makes it glow in the dark.

A wandering hole is a creature that exists in a different dimension but
extends into the normal world as a living emptiness, a hole in space. In its
expanded form, it resembles a 10ft x 10ft hole running 20ft to 50ft deep
(1d4+1 x10). The creature possesses the capacity to constrict its anti-mass
to a 1/4 inch square. Contracting itself from a 10ft x 10ft square to a 1/4in
x 1/4in square takes 1d4+1 rounds. Expanding its form back to 10ft x 10ft
takes only 1 round. The most common tactic used by wandering holes is
to constrict themselves to their smallest size, then, as an adventurer walks
above, the wandering hole expands, sending the victim plummeting down
its depth. The wandering hole then compresses itself anew to crush the
hapless victim. Victims of this tactic always run the risk of being surprised
(50%).
Victims who find themselves within the depths of a wandering hole
have but 1d4+1 rounds to get themselves out before the contracting critter
crushes them: on the last round, the constricting wandering hole crushes
the victim to death.
Wandering holes may be damaged, but only by spells or magic weapons
and items. When it dies, a wandering hole returns to its expanded size of
10ft x 10ft, but as a normal, nonliving hole in the ground.

Garbage Disposal

Piles of refuse cover the floor of this cavernous room. Bone mounds,
bodies and animal carcasses rot amid the stalagmites and stone columns.
The smell is horrible. A slanted granite slab leans against the 30-foot-tall
wall. A dazed elf lies on a pile of gnoll bodies. He moans feebly, and rolls
across the bloody bodies beneath him. He doesn’t appear to know where
he is.
Standing before the stone slab are 3 hill giants. The giants take turns
tossing refuse into a 10-foot-diameter hole cut into the stone. The giants
hoot and holler gleefully as they chuck bodies and half-eaten meals into
the pit. The giants continue shoveling things into the pit unless stopped.
They’ll eventually reach the poor elf.
If PCs intervene, the giants attack with wooden clubs. They also try to
grab PCs and throw them into the pit. Anyone thrown or knocked into the
hole lands amid a heap of dead bodies, bones and smelly garbage. That
PC also learns the secret of the pit that made the hill giants so happy: It’s
actually a wandering hole lying on the slanted wall. The hole constricts to
crush the garbage the giants toss into it, but prefers warm flesh.
Tovalit Greene is an elf from a noble family. He sought to prove himself
by taking down the hill giant clan that was ransacking elven villages along
the High Cavelis River. He was taken out with one hit from a giant’s club
and tossed into the pile of dead gnolls. Tovalit doesn’t remember who he
is, but his family pays 300 gp for his safe return (if PCs can figure out
where to take the poor elf).

A buzzing reverberates through the stone canyon if PCs disturb the

themselves into the air from rocky tunnels that lead underground to a nest
built into the canyon wall. The aggressive wasps attack anyone in the

The picturesque garden is the hunting ground of a giant weasel. The

miles around its den. The animal stalks prey by staying beneath the plant
life, then pops up out of the ferns and flowers to grab a victim in its teeth. It

Despite its name, a were-mist is not a form of true lycanthropy, but is a
monster than can inflict involuntary shapechanging upon other creatures.
The were-mist attacks by enveloping and attempting to transform an
opponent. The creature surrounded by the were-mist must make a saving
throw or be transformed into a ravening beast (similar in appearance to
a werewolf) that will attack at the were-mist’s directions. The were-mist
remains wrapped around the victim, but it can be attacked independently
without risk to the controlled creature. The were-mist itself can only be
harmed by silver or magical weapons (or with spells), but the beast-form
of its slaves may be damaged normally.
When the were-mist’s slave is weakened by combat, the mist will
attempt to move on to a new victim. As soon as it departs from a victim, the
spell is broken and the slave returns to normal shape and self-control. In
battle, the were-mist will attempt to move from victim to victim, causing
them to attack their allies, and discarding one puppet when it becomes
weak, moving to the next strongest potential victim.
Were-mists are solitary due to their rarity, rather than due to an
unwillingness to congregate; in rare instances there might be lairs
containing more than one of these creatures. Since they do not appear
to reproduce, such better-populated lairs might exist closer to whatever
“source” creates the mists.

Source of Confusion

A green tapered bottle with a large cork stuck in its end sits on a fourfoot-tall stone pedestal in this 60-foot-diameter circular chamber. Pinkish
mists bubble and roll fluidly inside the glass. Two doors lead out of the
room. Crumpled on the floor are eight skeletons. The skeletons appear
to have been ripped and torn apart. Clothing and bits of bone are cast
throughout the chamber.
The roiling contents of the bottle is a were-mist. Removing the bottle
from the shelf causes two portcullises to clank closed over the exits. The
gates are sturdy, but can be lifted by a couple of PCs and pushed up into
the door frame to lock them in place again.
The were-mist appears to be contained by the cork in the bottle neck,
but appearances are deceiving. The were-mist can flow easily through
pores in the old cork to escape its container. It waits until a PC is holding
the bottle before flowing out to engulf him. The skeletons are a group
of adventurers who were torn apart by one of their own when the mist
changed him into a feral beast. PCs looting the corpses can find 67 gp,
an onyx ring (50 gp), a calendar with nights of the eclipses marked, and
a gold key.

Revenge Served Cold

A fisherman wearing thick seal skin lies sprawled on an ice floe
surrounded by the freezing waters of the Icefringe Sea. He appears
unconscious, lying face down on the ice. A spear lies beside his gloved
hand. The wicked barb at the end of the spear is bloody and has a chunk

No’lan Frostreacher fishes the bitterly cold waves to feed his family.
He recently killed a young orca, however, and did not honor the kill. Its

The large killer whale tracked the fisherman to his home on the ice

No’lan’s wife disappeared beneath the cold waters. No’lan escaped onto a
floating sheet of ice but now suffers from exposure to the harsh elements.
The mother whale swims beneath the ice floe, pushing it forward and out
to sea. She leaps from the water to attack anyone helping the doomed
fisherman. Her weight causes the massive ice block to tip precariously,

Whalers’ Lament

A whaling ship glides across the ocean; its colorful sails tattered and
bleached by the sun. Sailors slump over the rails or hang motionless in the
tangled rigging. Blankets cover bodies stacked like cordwood on the deck.
The ship’s captain stands resolutely at the wheel, eyes forward, refusing
to turn his ship. A few seamen on deck beckon passing ships closer, some
looking as if they might jump into the deep to escape the ship of the dead
and dying.
The Lionfish angered a great sperm whale and the crew is paying the
price. The whale was struck by three harpoons, but broke free of the ropes.
It now follows the ship’s wake. When the Lionfish turns toward land, the
whale nudges it back into open water. When another ship sails near the
vessel, the whale sinks it. The sailors have been at sea for weeks now, and
their food is nearly gone. Many aboard died from sunstroke, dehydration
or starvation. The men refuse to throw the dead overboard to spite the
wicked whale.

Digging Out

Frantic villagers dig at the ruins of a collapsed house, pulling beams and
walls free. Others scoop dirt and debris up with their hands and buckets.
The people’s voices are frantic as they dig. A wooden roof lies at an angle
over the broken masonry pushed out beneath it. The people pause to listen
occasionally, and the sounds of digging coming up through the rubble can
be heard. The villagers have no idea why the building fell in upon itself,
but they believe the owner, a moneylender named Castor Wainwright, is
trapped inside.
The paranoid banker feared thieves breaking into his home to steal his
fortunes. He rigged the entire house with traps to protect himself and his
gold. Unfortunately, those same traps turned out to be a little too effective
when Castor heard a noise in the night. He pulled a lever to seal off the
rooms, but instead everything came crashing down around him and his
two bodyguards. The intruders turned out to be 2 wights that climbed

The wights made short work of the injured banker and his guards. When
rescuers break through the rubble, 5 wights are eagerly digging out to

Sea-wights are highly similar to normal wights, originating from bodies
in ocean-flooded tombs, bodies that were consigned to the depths of the
ocean, or from individuals – usually those of some power – who perished
beneath the dark waves. They have a more bloated appearance than
normal wights, and their skins are crusted with barnacles or other seagrowths, giving them a somewhat better armor class than a land-wight.
In the course of transforming into a sea-wight, the hands and feet become
webbed, allowing the creatures to swim at a rate of 90ft.
Sea-wights have a greater tendency than normal wights to associate
with and command other undead creatures. Although some sea-wights are
solitary, many sea-wight lairs are found in ship graveyards, forest-beds of
deep seaweed, and other places that may have a strong evil animus. In this
case, the lair will ordinarily contain the following:
1d4+4 Additional sea-wights
1d4 giant zombie sharks (50% chance)
2d10 giant zombie piranhas (q.v.) (75% chance)
1d10 human zombies (80% chance)
1 giant zombie octopus (10% chance)
All of the zombie creatures in a sea-wight lair will be under the control
of the strongest sea-wight. If this wight is killed, 2 rounds will be required
for the next strongest sea-wight to establish dominance over the creatures.
Giant zombie sharks and giant zombie octopi have an armor class
inferior by 1 point to the normal AC of the living creature, but have an

Will o’ the wisps are phantom-like shapes of eerie light, creatures that
live in dangerous places and try to lure travelers into quicksand, off the
edges of cliffs, etc. They usually inhabit swamps or high moors. They
can brighten or dim their own luminescence, and change their shapes as
well, to appear as a group of lights, a wisp of light, or in the glowing
wraithlike shape of a human (often female). They will generally depart if
the attempt to lead victims into danger fails, but if they are attacked they
can defend themselves with violent shocks of lightning-like power. These
creatures are intelligent, and can be forced to reveal the location of their
treasure hoards.

Lightning Lasses

Marsh gases rise around a 60-foot-tall rock promontory jutting out
over the Sin Mire Swamp. Standing around the edges of the cliff are six
detailed crystal statues of women. Each has flowing hair and delicate
features, and holds her hands before her, palms upward. Resting in each
woman’s hands is a silver page inscribed with delicate flowering writing.
The pages tell the story of a young woman sacrificed to protect her village
from the Lord of Lightning. Touching one of the silver pages causes a
glowing ball of light to rise up through that woman’s statue. The golden
light expands and brightens as long as the page is touched. The light fades
if the page is released. If two pages are touched at the same time, the lights
inside both statues brighten.
The lights rising inside the hollow statues are actually 6 will-o’the-wisps that live in the swamp below. The creatures rise up through
openings in the rock that once channeled water into the statues. The wisps
use their lights to trick curious visitors into setting off the plateau’s trap:
If four of the silver pages are touched at the same time, a lightning bolt
blasts out of the sky and strikes the plateau. The bolt does 5d6 points of
damage (save for half) to anyone standing near the statues.

Backwoods Cabin

A cabin in the woods is empty, but appears to be used seasonally by
deer hunters. The cabin has a single locked door and a window with
a closed shutter. The door and shutter open with a loud creak on rusty
hinges. A locked cabinet contains dried foodstuffs, and a couple of folded
blankets sit on a white shelf against one wall. A blanket is thrown across
a mattress stuffed with goose feathers. The bed appears to have been slept
in recently. A small fireplace in one corner contains embers from a recent
fire. Sitting in the fireplace is a charred caribou antler.
The creaking of the door draws the attention of 10 wolves that sleep
in a nearby den. The wolves killed the last hunters to use the cabin then
dragged their bodies to their den. One of the bodies has a pouch containing
6 gold nuggets worth 250 gp total.

and gnawed bones cover the ground. A shredded backpack lies by the sled.
A rolled blanket is dumped on the ice, and 42 sp are frozen to the ground.
They must be heated to be removed.
The sled dogs and their driver were attacked by 4 winter wolves as they
crossed the open tundra. The driver released the dogs, thinking they could
escape, but the wolves killed the animals before they could run far. The
driver didn’t last much longer. The wolves attack anyone investigating
the sled. The driver’s bloody body is in the wolves’ underground den. His

the island. Towering snow drifts push against the castle’s walls, allowing a
nimble PC to climb right up the deep snow to the top of the castle’s frozen

spikes driven through their midsections. Their hands and feet are frozen
into the ice wall.
The castle is home to Namacki, a grimlek demon that escaped its
masters and now lives out its days freely on the frozen wastes. The
grimlek commands 5 worgs that wander the castle and the lands around

Portraits of the Damned

Six-foot-tall portraits line the staircase leading up to the second floor
of this empty chateau. The pictures show members of the Corliss family,
well-known, but unscrupulous, winemakers in the village of Orlen. All
of the paintings show the family in various stages of decay, with their
bodies burned, hacked apart or poisoned. The family members suffered
their horrible fates after a witch cursed the family for selling her diluted
wine. The paintings – made long before the curse – showed the thieving
family members how they would die before their usually violent ends.
Two portraits hide the souls of Lady Ketyh and Sir Mahli Corliss. They
died together in the house, the last members of the family to own it. Their
bodies are still upstairs, one dead in a bathtub from a snakebite and the
other crushed under a chandelier. The pair returned as 2 vengeful wraiths
to exact revenge on the living. The wraiths leap through the portraits at

The Knight Errant

A warhorse charges through the forest, its eyes wide and sweat coating
its sides. It froths from the mouth and its breathing is labored. The animal
races ahead, refusing to stop. From the direction the horse came, a man
screams for help. His shrieks are loud in the stillness of the dark forest.
The obese knight Fergut the Brash decided over a dinner of roast lamb
and potatoes that he was meant to be a dragonslayer. He handcrafted thick
(and expansive) armor to withstand the creatures’ claws and gnashing
teeth, and insulated it with a magical cloth to withstand the elements. He
can barely move in the weighty metal armor, however, and relied on his
horse (which wasn’t too happy about carrying the “knight”) to help him
get to and from the wyrms he dreamed of chasing. He didn’t expect the
horse to bolt at the first sign of trouble.
Fergut lies on his back in the middle of the trees, trying desperately to
turn himself over or raise his sword. His armor is dented and battered. He
shouts for help if he sees PCs. Fergut’s first battle wasn’t with a dragon;
instead a wyvern spooked the warhorse and left Fergut on the ground
like a helpless turtle. The wyvern soars in to protect its meal from anyone
approaching the helpless knight. The wyvern turns its stinger – which has
proven ineffectual against Fergut’s armor – on PCs. Fergut rewards his
rescuers with a small cask of wine (but not the good stuff) from his cellar
if PCs get him back home intact. He regales them with his conquests the
entire way, and steps in to defend them from anyone they meet, although
he usually ends up making situations worse.

Monstrosities — xole to xorn

Xole
Hit Dice: 8+4
Armor Class: 2 [17]
Attacks: 1 two-handed mace (1d10+5) and tail (2d6)
Saving Throw: 8
Special: Constriction, immune to fire and cold
Move: 12
Alignment: Chaos
Number Encountered: 1d6
Challenge Level/XP: 10/1,400
Xoles bear a close physical resemblance to the salamanders of the
elemental plane of fire, having a somewhat human head, human arms, and
a serpentine body. Rather than being creatures of fire, however, the xoles
are creatures of stone, being native to the elemental plane of earth. As
such, they are immune to fire and cold, and can be affected by protection
from evil.
A xole is only slightly larger than a salamander; the torso of a xole
is equivalent to that of a seven-foot tall, but massive, person. The tail
is almost ten feet in length, which is the reason xoles are categorized
as “Large” size. Xoles generally carry heavy stone maces as weapons;
even xoles can only wield these weapons two-handed, and they cannot
be lifted by any creature not from the elemental plane of earth. If one of
the weapons is dropped to the ground, it will dissolve into the stone after
a period of a year and one day. If a xole hits successfully with its tail, it
inflicts automatic constriction damage thereafter.
Xoles can move through solid rock or earth, although it takes a full
round to enter solid stone.
There is no allegiance between xoles and xorns beyond the fact that
both types of creatures are native to the elemental plane of earth. Xoles,
obviously, are more organized than xorns, and are generally found on the
prime material plane in the service of some evil purpose, as contrasted to
the neutral and relatively purposeless wanderings of the xorns.

There’s a Xole in the Middle of the Sea

The Isle of Echoes is a three-mile-wide rocky island of volcanic
rock rising from the Reaping Sea. Little vegetation grows on the barren
outcropping of rock, and sailors who pass the strange place whisper of the
grinding crash of stones slamming together. Rocky bluffs and crags hide
the island’s interior, and any who land on the boulder-covered beaches
never return.

Twenty curling stone columns rise 30 feet into the air in the center
of a flat plateau at the island’s heart. The pillars stand in a wide circle.
Around them are hundreds of stone weapons resting unattended on the
rocky ground. Most of the weapons are large maces, but a few spears,
swords and clubs can also be found. Three four-foot-tall, flat-top blocks of
black stone surround a 12-foot-wide circular cauldron filled with bubbling
magma. Working the primitive forge are 3 xoles, each busy crafting stone
weapons for an unknown reason. The xoles attack anyone interrupting
their work.

Xorn are bizarre creatures, originally from the elemental planes of
earth, which eat precious metals and other minerals. They have a rocklike consistency, granting an extremely good armor class, and appear to
be made of stone. Xorn have a barrel-shaped body, radially symmetrical
with three eyes, three arms, three stubby legs, and a powerful mouth set in
the top of the creature’s body. The stone-like appearance grants the xorn a
tremendously good chance of surprising its enemies.
These creatures are immune to fire and cold damage, and take only
half damage from electrical attacks (no damage when saving throws are
successful). A xorn can swim through stone, but requires a full melee
round to enter solid rock, during which time it cannot attack. Phase
Door spells will utterly destroy a xorn that is traveling through rock or
readjusting its composition.
Xorn are particularly vulnerable to spells that affect earth and stone.
Move Earth spells may be used to hurl a xorn backwards 30ft and stun
them for a full round. Stone to flesh and rock to mud spells weaken the
xorn’s elemental structure, increasing the creature’s AC to 8 [11] until the
xorn concentrates for a full round to readjust its composition. Passwall
spells inflict 1d10+10 points of damage with no saving throw.

The Halfling’s Carriage

An upright metal box sits in the middle of the Thresheel Woods, its
sides gleaming silver in the little sunlight that penetrates the thick leaves
rustling overhead. The box is six feet tall and barely four feet wide. The
walls are beaten and scratched. A door in one side opens to reveal a
cramped interior with just enough room for one person to squeeze inside
(two if they really try). A word engraved in Common on the inside wall
reads “Onward.”
Halfling inventor Ollie Nematoad created the box to convey him
through the mountains rather than over them. Stepping inside, closing
the door and speaking the command causes the box to jerk downward
suddenly and disappear into the ground. Connected to the box via a heavy
chain are 2 xorn. The box gains the xorns’ swim through stone ability
when in motion. The xorn cannot break free of the magical chain binding
them to the box. Once the command word is spoken, however, the person
inside the box can’t control the box’s path (a definite design flaw) and
the imprisoned xorn gain free will to act. The creatures charge into the
ground, then circle back to attack the box and the person inside. Ollie
escaped using a special ring he keeps for just such an emergency. The box
immediately returns to the surface if the cabin is empty, pulling the xorn
with it and returning them to magical stasis until the command word is
spoken again.

Named after their distinctive call, Yaruga are agile, hammerheaded
lizards, 10ft in height, which walk on two long bird-like legs. Yaruga
graze on plants and grasses by day, but become vicious hunters by night.
During the day Yaruga are skittish and scare easily. They excrete a foulsmelling gas if approached within 50 ft, then run away; the gas blinds
anyone within 10ft of the Yaruga for 1d4 rounds (saving throw applies). At
night, Yaruga become extremely dangerous and aggressive, chasing their
prey down and kicking them to death before feasting on them. When they
make the initial charge, a yaruga’s running kick inflicts double damage on
a successful hit. Anyone sprayed by Yaruga-gas during the day becomes
the main target of the savage lizards by night. In the wild, Yaruga are

Coconut Gas

Coconuts hang from oversized palm trees growing wild throughout
the Seething Jungle. The coconuts are part of a defensive perimeter
set up around the village of Cata’Anar to keep beasts out. Jungle vines
crisscrossing the weed-covered ground rise into the trees to connect to
some hollowed-out coconuts rigged to fall on creatures tripping the trap.
The Cata’Anar natives drill holes into the coconuts to empty them out.
They then refill the coconuts with chopped up yaruga glands.
The coconuts split open when they strike the ground (or unlucky PCs).
The glands explode in a 10-foot-radius, covering unwanted visitors in the
smelly chunks and the foul-smelling yaruga gas. The gas blinds anyone
for 1d4 rounds unless they make a saving throw. Animals approaching
Cata’Anar are driven away by the nauseating gas and glands. The chunks
can be picked off, but the smell of the gas takes 1d4 days to wash away.
The villagers use a mixture of crushed coconut, vinegar and turtle blood.
They’ll sell the goopy concoction to PCs for 300 gp.
The jungle is home to 8 yaruga that roam the area, drawn by the scent

of the glands. They gather in force at night to attack anyone struck by one
of the coconut traps and coated in the foul-smelling gas.

Winter Green

A mammoth lies on its side in the field of deep snow beneath an
overhanging ice ridge, its furry body a brown lump marring the pristine
white expanse. Its curving tusks jut from the snowfield like massive ribs.
A massive icicle-like spear juts from the mammoth’s side. Frozen blood
stains the white snow in arcs around it. Many more sharp icicles hang
like teeth from the icy promontory rising above the dead mammoth.
Small green humanoids slash at the mammoth’s body, ripping into its
flesh. Snow drifts surround the vicious creatures as they hack at the dead
animal’s body.
The icy ridge is the “kingdom” of a yeti and his servants, 8 clawed
fiends. The clawed fiends wear polar bear skins to protect themselves
from the biting cold. They are loyal to the yeti, which keeps them fed
in the harsh environment by occasionally bringing down some of the
larger animals. The yeti hides as one of the snow drifts away from the
clawed fiends and mammoth. It lets its servants attack first before it rises
up to surprise PCs. The massive yeti throws icicle spears (2d4 points of

Ygg (commonly called ‘Gallows Trees’) are ancient, tree-like predators
that impale both beast and man on the thorn-covered bark of their snaking
branches. An Ygg’s branches can whip out to a distance of 30ft to seize
prey, who must make a successful saving throw to avoid being caught
(the Ygg can use 1d6 of these branches in any given combat round). Once
impaled upon the massive thorns, the life force and nutrients of the victim
is drained at the rate of 1 hit point per round, leaving the empty husks to
slough off in the fullness of time. Any man-sized creature has a 1 in 6
chance per round of pulling free of the branch. Reeking of putrefaction
and festooned with corpses, Ygg roam the countryside in search of flesh,
producing a cloud of spores (60ft radius) that draws creatures to them.
Prey within the sporecloud must make a saving throw (each round) or be
drawn closer to the Ygg. Once the Ygg attacks, these victims come to their
senses, but it may be too late. Ygg have no visual organs but can detect
any creatures within 60ft using sound, scent, and vibration. They are immune to cold, but are susceptible to fire (+1 damage per hit die). Folklore

Thorny Decision

A hedge of wickedly sharp three-foot-long thorns surrounds the Bauxile
Precipice, a 100-foot-tall slab of black rock rising into the storm-filled sky.
Steps cut into the black rock ring the slender stone. The bodies of men and
beasts are impaled on the thorns, their desiccated remains scratched and
torn by the fast-growing and decidedly deadly hedge. A wall of bleached
bones lies at the base of the hedge, and skeletal remains hang precariously
in the thorns.
Two golden bowls containing peach-like fruits sit on a red-stone altar
atop the rock. One bowl of fruit heals 2d8 points of damage, while the

Yienhool
Hit Dice: 1d6hp
Armor Class: 8 [11]
Attacks: 1 claw (1d4)
Saving Throw: 18

Yienhools are pale humanoids with long, thin arms and elongated,
clawed hands. Their bulging, white eyes are well adapted to dim light, but
they are virtually blind in sunlight and never emerge from below ground
unless forced to do so. They are deep-dwellers of the underground, but
small groups of them are occasionally found in the upper reaches of the
subterranean world. Yienhools are more intelligent than animals, but
barely so - they can communicate and follow orders, and in packs they can
hunt with considerable cunning, but their ability to act independently of
a pack or a strong leader is very weak. Yienhool packs swarm their prey,
the first ranks grabbing, clutching, and immobilizing to allow their total
numbers to swarm over the foe and bring them down. If a yienhool hits,
it has grabbed successfully at one of the foe’s arms, rendering weapon
or shield unusable as the yienhool clings on, regardless of danger (such
attacks are made at -1 to hit). While holding on, the yienhool can make
more attempts to grab the other arm as well. Yienhool can swarm over the
backs of their fighting brethren to climb past front ranks and into the rear
ranks of their opponents. If a yienhool is not already holding an enemy,
and chooses not to make grabbing attacks, it can attack with its claws.
These creatures are usually encountered in large numbers, for they do not
divide into packs of fewer than 6.
Yienhool packs are often led by unusually large and vicious specimens
of the race who are much more intelligent – or, at least more cunning –
than the average member of the species. These leaders are normally of
3HD, but some can be as large as trolls, with 5-7 hit dice.

One Note or Two?

A silver whistle (100 gp) sits on a jade gargoyle head protruding from
the rock wall of this water-filled cave. The whistle is four inches long and
has two openings cut along its length. The whistle produces a high-pitched
sound humans can’t hear. The noise causes considerable pain to animals,
however. Covering the first hole and blowing a note summons 1d4 war
dogs to serve the PC for 2d6 hours. This note can be blown once per week
to summon the dogs. Covering both holes and blowing causes 3d4+4
yienhools to converge on the instrument. The yienhools mercilessly attack
the whistle’s wielder. They steal the offending instrument if possible and
destroy it.

Hounds of Yith are supernatural creatures of the night, resembling large

of existence, and they are summoned to the hunt by powerful and malign
beings. The baying of the hounds causes fear within 100ft (per the spell).
Normal weapons do not damage the hounds of Yith: silver weapons inflict
only 1hp damage per hit, and magical weapons inflict 1hp per point of tohit bonus. The hounds have 10% resistance to magic.

Hounds of Hell

The villagers of the small hamlet of Appenzell each wear a studded
leather strap around their necks. They watch visitors nervously, and none
dares approach outsiders. The tavern owner grudgingly serves one drink,
but won’t rent rooms for the night. Emelda, a young serving girl, quietly
warns PCs to leave immediately.
An evil wizard named Traywick cursed the town after the constable
slew his favorite mastiffs for nearly killing a small child. Traywick made a
deal with a demon lord to punish the villagers. Nearly a year ago, demonic
servants quietly wrapped leather collars around the necks of everyone in
town — including Traywick’s.
Every full moon, two random villagers turn into 2 hounds of Yith and
wreak havoc through the countryside. The villagers long ago learned to
identify which of their number would change each month, and lock the
two chosen in a large barn outside town. The rest hide in their homes
hoping the hounds don’t escape and come looking for them. The scent of
new blood in the village draws the hounds to PCs.
The curse can be broken by killing Traywick and burning the leather
collar he wears. Traywick attempted to magically remove the strap soon
after he awoke with it. The effort cost him his head, and turned him
permanently into a headless hound that now wanders the valley about his
vacant manor home.

Fat and ugly toad-like humanoids, the Yurmp are bandits and
scroungers. Though of fine material, such as silk, their clothes are torn
and soiled. Any armour is mismatched and poorly maintained, held
together by rusty buckles and double-wrapped cords. Yurmp have sour
expressions and grumpy attitudes, often becoming impatient and bored
while waiting beside a road or path for someone to ambush. Their
weapons are generally polearms looted from battle sites. If yurmp are
able to coordinate an ambush, they have an increased chance of surprising
their opponents (1-3 on 1d6). In villages that tolerate their presence
they are usually part of any organised crime; in areas where they are not
tolerated, yurmp live by “finding” dropped items and digging through
the garbage of other races, bemoaning their poor luck all the while.
For every 5 yurmp in a group there is a cumulative 2 in 6 chance that a
wrestler yurmp will be present. These grossly fat yurmps disdain weapons
and armour, and strike for 1d6 damage in unarmed combat. If the unarmed
attack succeeds by four or more points, the wrestler has a firm hold on
the foe and can throw him to the ground, disarm him, prevent attacks, or
inflict continuous strangling damage (1d6 per round). Wrestler yurmps
have an effective Strength score of 18, and usually enjoy challenging
humans to arm wrestling contests. The rest of the yurmp enjoy gambling
on these contests. If yurmp are able to attack by stealth or surprise from
behind, they gain +4 on the attack and inflict double normal damage.

An Offer You Can’t Refuse

A dilapidated carriage waits in the middle of the road as PCs to
approach. Trash litters the ground around the expensive vehicle, and a fat,
toad-like creature sits on the driver’s bench. Instead of horses, the thing
is pulled by a team of 3 giant horned toads. The toads sit peacefully,
snatching flies from the air. A grossly obese hand holds a silk handkerchief
out the carriage’s window, waving PCs over. Standing behind and atop
the carriage are more toad creatures, each armed with crossbows. The
carriage is the conveyance of a fat blobby toad creature named Dung
Vianco, a fastidious yurmp. He is protected by 5 yurmps.
Dung’s prize, a wrestler yurmp named Rouss, ate tainted berries
that drove him mad. The crazed giant of a yurmp hides off the road in a
nearby cornfield. Dung wants his fighter returned so they can feed him an
antidote. He asks PCs to do this favor for him. If they don’t, he turns the
giant horned toads and his lackeys loose on them. It’s their choice, after
all.

Zetans are a grey skinned collective-intelligence race originally
hailing from somewhere beyond the material plane. Workers are about
four feet tall, and leaders are as tall as six feet. All zetans have thin arms
and legs, oversized heads and eyes, and extremely long fingers. They
are encountered most frequently on the Ethereal and Astral planes. Their
purpose in visiting the Material Plane is a mystery, although they have been
known to abduct mortals or livestock, sometimes in broad daylight. Zetans
have an aura which causes Fear (as per the spell, saving throw negates),
and they are immune to non-magical weapons. It is believed that Zetans
are not truly evil, but merely inscrutable and totally alien in motivation;
individuals that have met the Zetans will have wildly different stories to
tell about them. Smaller Zetans seem to function most often as workers;
the taller leader-types are conjectured to have more independence, but
still serve the collective. Zetans travel in a thought conveyance which
is only temporarily physical, glows various unearthly colors, and is able
to become invisible (by entering the Ethereal Plane) at will. For every
fifteen Zetans there will always be at least one leader type. A leader must
be present for transport of any mortals or livestock. If a Zetan is killed
on the prime material plane it is dispatched back to the collective unless
its leader is killed as well, in which case it is dispersed. More permanent
Zetan fortresses may exist under some of the more inaccessible desert
areas of the world; nomads speak of the sound of great machines beneath
the sands.

Little Gray Men

The Exetyr Inn & Tavern is a bustling place, with a lively clientele
dancing, singing and, of course, drinking the night away. The party never
seems to stop. The tavern is run by Endril Mackeal, a female barbarian
from the frozen north strand. Endril always takes part in the drinking and
dancing, and sometimes shares stories of her days adventuring. She has
faced dragons and demons, and killed grizzlies with her bare hands. A
bear-skin rug she killed and skinned herself rests on the floor in the middle
of the tavern.
But Endril’s newest challenge is vexing her to no end: Guests are
vanishing from the inn’s upper attic rooms. Three people are missing now,
and Endril has no answer as to where they might be. She’s stumped, and
worried more people might vanish. She fears her business will suffer if
word gets out that it’s dangerous to stay at the Exetyr. She’s offering a 20
gp reward for anyone who’ll stay the night in the upper rooms and bring
her an answer. The local patrons know better; they’ve heard the stories of
bright flashing lights swirling around the attic windows and they’ve seen
the carved up and bloodless cattle in the fields the next morning.

Anyone staying on the upper floor awakens to find 10 grey-skinned
creatures scurrying about the room and surveying the PC with their long,
black eyes. A larger creature stands to the side, directing the unknown
actions. The creatures are 10 Zetan workers and 1 Zetan leader. They
attempt to take one PC captive to experiment upon. Kidnapped villagers
are never seen again.

Zombies are mindless creatures, the walking dead. (These are merely
animated corpses, not carriers of any sort of undead contagion as are
ghouls.) If their Undeath is contagious, they should be worth a few more
experience points than described here, and if a single hit from a zombie
causes contagion or any other sort of disease, they should be worth
considerably more experience. However, the standard zombie is simply a
corpse animated to do its creator’s bidding.

Waterlogged

This stone hallway slopes down into a large chamber filled nearly to
the ceiling with brackish water. Blubbery balls of bloated flesh and bits
of gore float atop the water. A dead gnoll floats face down in the water, its
wet fur smelling heavily of rot. A treasure chest on the floor of the flooded
chamber contains 129 gp, a gold swan statue (50 gp) and a magical wand
of the Referee’s choosing.
The floating balls of flesh are 8 bloated zombies. The zombies’ bodies
make them incredibly buoyant so that they float freely in the water. They
splash awkwardly to get to PCs in the water.

Brain-eaters are a rare variety of zombie, appearing as bloated, swollenheaded walking corpses. These semi-intelligent monsters hunger for the
brains of intelligent creatures, especially those with the ability to cast
spells. Brain-eaters are capable of absorbing the energy of magical spells
cast near them, negating any effect they might have had. A brain-eater
may absorb up to 2d4 spell levels, its head growing ever larger during
the process. When its capacity is reached, the brain-eater’s head violently
explodes. A brain-eater regains the ability to absorb an additional spell
level with each fresh brain it eats.

Bobble-Headed Bodyguards

Dozens of decomposing bodies lie on the stone floor inside this foulsmelling chamber. Most of the corpses are missing the tops of their skulls,
and their brains have been scooped out. Blood spatters the stone floor and
pools in congealed lumps. Other bodies are bloated beyond belief, their
heads swollen to humongous dimensions. The brain-less bodies belong to
villagers who were kidnapped and locked in this room to feed 10 braineating zombies. The bloated bodies are the zombies, each with a massive
head from absorbing spells cast at their death-worshipping cleric master,
Lonan Cur.
Lonan uses the zombies as undead shields to absorb spells cast at him.
He walks inside a circle of the undead as he ransacks small villages and
hamlets around the region. As he leaves with the village’s gold, he grabs a
few villagers to feed the engorged zombies.

are immune to sleep and charm spells. Anyone slain by a Leper Zombie
reanimates as a leper zombie in 1d6 rounds. Carrying equipment, arms
or armor of one slain by a leper zombie or used to destroy a leper zombie
carries a risk to the bearer, they must save vs disease at +4 each day or

Death Warmed Over

A lone figure sits bundled in blankets before the ashes of a campfire
along the banks of a pristine pond. A large cooking pot sits atop the flames,
still half-filled with water. A wagon waits in the trees, bodies in the back
huddled under blankets.
The figure in front of the fire is a woman with bright red hair. Her
arms are marred by sores, and her throat is scratched open. Her legs are
burned and blackened. She’s been dead less than a day. The woman and
her companions drank from the tainted pond and turned into 8 leper
zombies. The undead leap from the wagon to attack passers-by. The
zombies killed their mounts after they turned. The animals’ bodies lay
a slight ravine down a steep rocky slope behind the wagon. The wagon
contains the group’s belongings, including 60 sp, a large rocking chair,
six ivory drinking horns (60 gp), and various items of clothing. All of the
clothes are tainted with leprosy that turns someone wearing them into a
leper zombie if they fail a saving throw.

Raze the city of Dalstrak. Unfortunately, the city was destroyed hundreds

A massive flock of raven’s blocks out the sun, turning the day to night

to be chasing the lead birds. The lead birds bank and swerve trying to

zombie ravens hunting the living birds. The decomposing birds barely
flap through the air, but turn and dive on PCs.
